Solar Engineer Journey
Sun :
Fungi can survive without sun.Yet fungi depend on dead plant which also depend on sunlight hence all thing need sunlight.
Sun .Solar energy is needed on earth.Wind movement ,water movement and dead organic matter rely on sun .
Coal or fossil fuel are exposed to heat before it is used.
NB After 500million year ago so 10^23Joule fossil od energy was given to earth before humans extracted.
   A-5000 =500million=500000000, E=10^23 
Annual use  of fossil is =E/A=2*10^14Joule
NB:10^20joule/year of power is used globally.Fossil is for car alongside electricity generation.
100 years to come fossil will be extinct since is non-renewable.
Renewable source are wind for turbine.
We will able to predict Energy of source is abundant if its[renewable source] impacts on climate assuming   
is available or assuming for example if is not there what will happen.
Solar has ultimate power to power earth to life but why is under utilized .find more and share.Sun supply 731*10^20 or 
23000 terawatt-years per year  while use 19terawatt years  is earth energy annual demand.
 Coal — a finite resource — only has
830 TWy of energy
