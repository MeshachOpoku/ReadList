and I.M.Yaglom 

This book contains 320 unconventional problems in algebra, arithmetic, elementary 
number theory and trigonometry. Most of the problems first appeared in 
competitive examinations sponsored by the School Mathematical Society of the 
Moscow State University and in the Mathematical Olympiads held in Moscow. 
Although most of the problems presuppose only high school mathematics, they are 
not easy; some are of uncommon difficulty and will challenge the ingenuity of any 
research mathematician. Nevertheless, many are well within the reach of motivated 
high school students and even advanced seventh and eighth graders. 

The problems are grouped into twelve separate sections. Among these art': the 
divisibility of integers, equations having integer solutions, evaluating sums and 
products, miscellaneous algebraic problems, the algebra n! polynomials, complex 
numbers, problems of number theory, distinctive inequalities, dill erenee sequences 
and sums, and more. 

Complete solutions to all problems are given; in many eases, alter nale solutions are 
detailed from different points of view. Solutions to iimro advanced problems are 
given in considerable detail. Moreover, when advanced concepts arc employed, 
they are discussed in the section preredingthc problems. 11scful in a variety ol ways

FOREWORD TO THE 
THIRD (Russian) EDITION 


This book contains 320 unconventional problems in algebra, arithme¬ 
tic, elementary number theory, and trigonometry. Most of these 
problems first appeared in competitive examinations sponsored by the 
School Mathematical Society of the Moscow State University and in 
the Mathematical Olympiads held in Moscow. The book is designed 
for students having a mathematical background at the high school 
level; r very many of the problems are within reach of seventh and 
eighth grade students of outstanding ability. Solutions are given 
for all the problems. The solutions for the more difficult problems 
are especially detailed. 

The third (Russian) edition differs from the second chiefly in the 
elimination of errors detected in the second edition. Therefore, the 
preface to the second edition is retained. 

t The level of academic attainment referred to as “high school level’' is the 
American ninth to twelfth grades. The USSR equivalent is seventh to tenth 
grades. This means that this material is introduced about two years earlier 
in the Russian schools. Since Russian children begin their first grade studies 
about a year later than do American children, the actual age disparity is not 
as much as two years [Editor], 


PREFACE TO THE 
SECOND (Russian) EDITION 


The present volume, which constitutes the first part of a collection, 
contains 320 problems involving principally algebra and arithmetic, 
although several of the problems are of a type meant only to encourage 
the development of logical thought (see, for example, problems 1-8). 

The problems are grouped into twelve separate sections. The last 
four sections (Complex Numbers, Some Problems from Number Theory, 
Inequalities, Numerical Sequences and Series) contain important theo¬ 
retical material, and they may well serve as study topics for school 
mathematical societies or for the Society on Elementary Mathematics 
at the pedagogical institutes. In this respect the supplementary refer¬ 
ences given in various sections will also prove useful. All the other 
sections [especially Alterations of Digits in Integers and Solutions 
of Equations in Integers (Diophantine equations)] should yield material 
profitable for use in mathematics clubs and societies. 

Of the twelve sections, only four (Miscellaneous Problems in Algebra, 
Polynomial Algebra, Complex Numbers, Inequalities) concern algebra; 
the remaining sections deal with arithmetic and number theory. A 
special effort has been made to play down problems (particularly those 
in algebra) involving detailed manipulative matter. This was done 
to avoid duplicating material in the excellent Problem Book in Algebra ,

by V. A. Kretchmar (Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow 
1950). On the other hand, an effort has been made to render much 
of the book attainable to eighth grade, and even seventh grade, 
students. 

More than three years have passed since the appearance of the first 
edition of this book. During this period the original authors received 
a great many written and oral communications with respect to it, 
and these have been seriously considered in the reworking of the 
material and in deciding which features were worth retaining and 
emphasizing and which aspects were weak. As a result, the book 
has undergone considerable revision. About sixty problems that were 
in the first edition have been omitted—some appeared to be too diffi¬ 
cult, or were insufficiently interesting, and others did not fit into 
the new structure of the book. Approximately 120 new problems have 
been added. The placing of each problem into a suitable section 
has been restudied; the sections have been repositioned; all the solu¬ 
tions have been reworked (several were replaced by simplified or 
better solutions); and alternative solutions have been provided for 
some of the problems. Hints have been given for every problem, 
and those problems which to the authors appear of greater difficulty 
have been starred(*). Sections 3, 5, 6, 9, and 10 have undergone such 
significant changes that they may be considered as having been com¬ 
pletely rewritten. Sections 1, 2, 4, 7, and 11 have been revised radi¬ 
cally, and only Sections 8 and 12 have had relatively minor alterations. 

The first edition of the book was prepared by I. M. Yaglom in 
collaboration with G. M. Adelson-Vel’sky (who contributed the section 
on alteration of digits in integers and also a number of problems to 
other sections, particularly to the section on Diophantine equations). 
An important contribution was made to the first edition by E. E. 
Balash (who contributed the section on numerical sequences and series) 
and Y. I. Khorgin (who made the principal contribution to the section 
on inequalities). Solutions for other problems were written by various 
directors of the School Mathematical Society of the Moscow State 
University. About 20 problems were taken from manuscripts of the 
late D. O. Shklarsky. 

The rewriting of the book for the second edition was done by I. 
M. Yaglom, who made extensive use of the material of the first 
edition. 

In conclusion, the author wishes to thank A. M. Yaglom, whose 
advice was of invaluable assistance while the book was being written 
and who initiated the rewriting of the section on complex numbers. 


Preface to the Second Edition 

The author is also indebted to the editor, A. Z. Rivkin, whose inde¬ 
fatigable labors on the first and second editions made possible many 
improvements, and to all the readers who made valuable suggestions, 
especially I. V. Volkova, L. I. Golovina, R. S. Guter, G. Lozanovsky, 
I. A. Laurya, Y. B. Rutitsky, A. S. Sokolin, and I. Y. Tanatar.

EDITOR’S FOREWORD TO THE 
ENGLISH EDITION 


One of the important facets of science education in the USSR has 
been their series of mathematical competitive examinations held for 
students of high ability in the secondary schools. Those contests, 
which are being emulated increasingly in our own educational system, 
culminate each year in the Soviet Union in their Mathematical 
Olympiads held at Moscow University, preliminary qualifying and 
elimination examinations having been held nationwide throughout the 
academic year. 

This book, compiled over a twenty-year period, is a collection of 
the most interesting and instructive problems posed at these compe¬ 
titions and in other examination centers of the USSR, plus additional 
problems and material developed for use by the School Mathematics 
Study Societies. Perhaps the greatest compliment which can be paid 
to the problems created for this purpose by leading Soviet mathema¬ 
ticians (or taken and adapted from the literature) has been the extent 
to which the problems have been used in our own contests and ex¬ 
aminations. 

Soviet students and teachers have had available in published form 
the problems, and their solutions, given in such examinations, but 
this material has not generally been available in the United States. 


xi 


11 Olympiad Problem 

A few of these problems have been translated and published in such 
American journals as The American Mathematical Monthly of The 
Mathematical Association of America, and problems of similar scope 
appear as regular features of Several American journals. Except for 
some compilations from these sources, little exists by way of problems 
which deal with real and active mathematics instead of the fringe 
and recreational aspects of the science or with conventional textbook 
exercises. 

This translation and revision of the Third Revised and Augmented 
Edition of the Olympiad Problem Book should therefore fill a very 
definite need in American schools and colleges. It contains 320 
problems—a few of them merely recreational and thought-provoking, 
but most of them seriously engaged with solid and important 
mathematical theory, albeit the preparational background is assumed 
to be elementary. The problems are from algebra, arithmetic, 
trigonometry, and number theory, and all of them emphasize the 
creative aspects of these subjects. The material coordinates beauti¬ 
fully with the new concepts which are being emphasized in American 
schools, since the “unconventional” designation attributed to the 
problems by the original authors means that they stress originality 
of thought rather than mere manipulative ability and introduce the 
necessity for finding new methods of attack. 

In this respect I am reminded of the observation made by some 
forgotten character in some forgotten novel who opined that the 
ultimate test of an educative effort lay not nearly so much in what 
sort of questions the students could finally answer as in what sort 
of questions they could finally be asked! 

Complete solutions to all problems are given; in many cases, 
alternate solutions are detailed from different points of view. 
Although most of the problems presuppose only high school mathe¬ 
matics, they are not in any sense easy: some are of uncommon 
difficulty and will challenge the ingenuity of any research mathe¬ 
matician. On the other hand, many of the problems will yield readily 
to a normally bright high school student willing to use his head. 
Where more advanced concepts are employed, the concepts are dis¬ 
cussed in the section preceding the problems, which gives the volume 
the aspect of a textbook as well as a problem book. The solutions 
to more advanced problems are given in considerable detail. 

Hence this book can be put to use in a variety of ways for students 
of ability in high schools and colleges. In particular, it lends itself 
exceptionally well to use in the various Institutes for high school

mathematics teachers. It is certainly required reading for teachers 
dealing with the gifted student and advanced placement classes. It 
will furnish them with an invaluable fund for supplementary teaching 
material, for self-study, and for acquiring depth in elementary 
mathematics. 

Except for the elimination of the few misprints and errors found 
in the original, and some recasting of a few proofs which did not 
appear to jell when translated literally, the translation is a faithful 
one: it was felt that the volume would lose something by too much 
tampering. (For this reason the original foreword and preface have 
also been retained). Thus the temptation to radically alter or simplify 
any understandable solution was resisted (as, for example, in the 
sections on number theory and inequalities, where congruence 
arithmetic would certainly have supplied some neater and more direct 
proofs). Some notations which differ in minor respects from the 
standard American notations have been retained (as, for example, 
Cl instead of Cl). These will cause no difficulty. 

All references made in the text to books not available in English 
translation have been retained; no one can know when translations 
of some of those volumes will appear. Whenever an English trans¬ 
lation was known to exist, the translated edition is referred to. 

The translation was made from the Third (Russian) Edition of 
Selected Problems and Theorems of Elementary Mathematics , which 
is the title under which the original volume appeared in the Soviet 
Union. Mr. John Maykovich, instructor at the University of Santa 
Clara, was the translator, and he was assisted by Mrs. Alvin (Myra) 
White, who translated fifty pages. The writing out, revising, editing, 
annotating, and checking against the original Russian were by my 
own hand. 

Thanks are due the following persons for their assistance in reading 
portions of the translation, pointing out errors, and making valuable 
suggestions: Professor George Polya of Stanford University/ Professor 
Abraham Hillman of the University of Santa Clara, and Professor 
Robert Rosenbaum of Wesleyan University. 

I shall be very grateful to readers who are kind enough to point 
out errors, misprints, misleading statements of problems, and in¬ 
correct or obscure proofs found in this edition.

T I would also like to call attention to Professor Polya’s new book Mathe¬ 
matical Discovery (Wiley) which contains elementary problems and valuable 
textual discussion of approaches to, and techniques of, problem solving.

FROM THE AUTHORS 


The three volumes that make up the present collection of problems 
are the commencement of a series of books based on material 
gathered by the School Mathematics Society of the Moscow State 
University over a twenty-year period. The text consists of problems 
and theorems, most of which have been presented during meetings 
of the various sections of the School Mathematical Society of the 
M.S.U. as well as in the Mathematical Olympiads held in Moscow. 
(The numbers of the problems given in the Olympiads are listed on 
p. 5). 

These volumes are directed to students, teachers, and directors of 
school mathematical societies and societies on elementary mathematics 
of the pedagogical institutes. The first volume (Part I) contains 
problems in arithmetic, algebra, and number theory. The second 
volume is devoted to problems in plane geometry, and the third to 
problems in solid geometry. 

In contrast to the majority of problem books intended for high 
school students, these books are designed not only to reinforce the 
student's formal knowledge, but also to acquaint him with methods 
and ideas new to him and to develop his predilection for, and ability 
in, original thinking. Here, there are few problems whose solutions 


1 


2 


From the Authors 


require mere formal mastery of school mathematics. Also, there are 
few problems intended for the superficially “clever” or adroit student 
—that is, problems involving artificial methods for solving equations 
or systems of equations of higher degree. On the other hand, these 
books do contain many problems demanding originality and non- 
standardized formulations. 

In the selection of problems, emphasis has been given to those 
aspects of elementary mathematics which are pertinent to contempo¬ 
rary mathematical developments and new directions. Several groups 
of problems are worked out in detail in the section on answers and 
hints, especially when individual problems involve more mature 
mathematics (for instance, elementary number theory and inequali¬ 
ties). Some of the problems have been taken from classics of the 
mathematical literature and from articles published in recent mathe¬ 
matical journals. 

In view of the unconventional nature of the problems, they may 
prove difficult for students accustomed to conventional high school 
exercises. Nevertheless, the School Mathematical Society of the 
M.S.U. and the directors of the Moscow Mathematical Olympiads 
believe that such problems are not beyond the persevering student. 

It is recommended that the suggestions for using this book be read 
before the problems are undertaken. 

Parts I and II of this work were compiled by I. M. Yaglom, and Part 
III was done principally by N. N. Chentzov. In addition to the listed 
authors, many directors of the School Mathematical Society of the 
M.S.U. contributed; their names are listed in the Preface to each 
volume. Some forty problems were taken from the manuscripts of 
D. O. Shklarsky, who worked with the School Mathematical Society 
from 1936 to 1941, and who was killed in action on the military front 
in 1942. In view of the very great influence which D. O. Shklarsky 
exerted through his work with the Society, and in particular upon 
the contents of this volume, it is appropriate to place his name first 
in authorship of it. 

The authors will be grateful to readers who send them new, and 
possibly better, solutions to the problems or new problems suitable 
for inclusion in such a book as this. 


SUGGESTIONS FOR USING THIS BOOK 


This book contains (1) statements of problems, (2) solutions, (3) 
answers and hints for solving the problems. For more effective use 
of the book, the answers and hints appear at the end. 

The starred problems are more difficult, in the opinion of the 
authors, than the others; the few double-starred problems are the 
most difficult. (Naturally, there will be differences of opinion as to 
which problems are more difficult than others.) 

For most of the problems the authors recommend that the reader first 
attempt a solution without recourse to the hints. If this attempt is 
unsuccesful, the hint can be referred to, which should aid in arriving 
at a solution. If, then, the reader cannot solve a problem, he can (of 
course) read the solution; but if he appears to be successful in find¬ 
ing a solution, he should compare his answer with that given in the 
answers and hints section. If his answer disagrees with that given, 
he should try to determine his possible mistake and correct it. If 
the answers agree, he should compare his solution with that given 
in the solutions section. If several solutions are given in the answers 
section, the reader will profit by comparing the various solutions. 

These suggestions are perhaps not as pertinent to the starred prob¬ 
lems as they are to the others. For the starred problems it might

INTRODUCTORY PROBLEMS 


1. Every living person has shaken hands with a certain number 
of other persons. Prove that a count of the number of people who 
have shaken hands an odd number of times must yield an even 
number. 

2. In chess, is it possible for the knight to go (by allowable moves) 
from the lower left-hand corner of the board to the upper right-hand 
corner and in the process to light exactly once on each square?

3. (a) N rings having different outer diameters are slipped onto 
an upright peg, the largest ring on the bottom, to form a pyramid 
(Figure 1). We wish to transfer all the rings, one at a time, to a 
6 


second peg, but we have a third (auxiliary) peg at our disposal. 
During the transfers it is not permitted to place a larger ring on a 
smaller one. What is the smallest number, k , of moves necessary 
to complete the transfer to peg number 2?t 

(b)* A brain-teaser called the game of Chinese Rings is con¬ 
structed as follows: n rings of the same size are each connected to 
a plate by a series of wires, all of which are the same length (see 
Figure 2). A thin, doubled rod is slipped through the rings in such 
a way that all the wires are inside the U-opening of the rod. (The 
wires are free to slide in holes in the plate, as shown.) The problem 
consists of removing all the rings from the rod. What is the least 
number of moves necessary to do this?

4. (a) We are given 80 coins of the same denomination; we know 
that one of them is counterfeit and that it is lighter than the others. 
Locate the counterfeit coin by using four weighings on a pan balance. 

(b) It is known that there is one counterfeit coin in a collec¬ 
tion of n similar coins. What is the least number of weight trials 
necessary to identify the counterfeit? 

5. Twenty metal blocks are of the same size and external ap¬ 
pearance; some are aluminum, and the rest are duraluminum, which 
is heavier. Using at most eleven weighings on a pan balance, how 
can we determine how many blocks are aluminum? 

6. (a)* Among twelve similar coins there is one counterfeit. It 
is not known whether the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier than 
a genuine one (all genuine coins weigh the same). Using three 
weighings on a pan balance, how can the counterfeit be identified 
and in the process determined to be lighter or heavier than a genuine 
coin? 

t This is sometimes referred to as the Tower of Hanoi problem [Editor]. 




Introductory Problems 

(b)** There is one counterfeit coin among 1000 similar coins. 
It is not known whether the counterfeit coin is lighter or heavier 
than a genuine one. What is the least number of weighings, on a 
pan balance, necessary to locate the counterfeit and to determine 
whether it is light or heavy? 

Remark . Using the conditions of problem (a) it is possible to locate, in three 
weighings, one counterfeit out of thirteen coins, but we cannnot determine 
whether it is light or heavy. For fourteen coins, four weighings are necessary. 

It would be interesting to determine the least number of weighings necessary 
to locate one counterfeit out of 1000 coins if we are relieved of the necessity 
of determining whether it is light or heavy. 

7. (a) A traveler having no money, but owning a gold chain 
having seven links, is accepted at an inn on the condition that he 
pay one link per day for his stay. If the traveler is to pay daily, 
but may take change in the form of links previously paid, and if he 
remains seven days, what is the least number of links that must be 
cut out of the chain? (A ote: A link may be taken from any part 
of the chain.) 

(b) A chain consists of 2000 links. What is the least number 
of links that must be disengaged from the chain in order that any 
specified number of links, from 1 to 2000, may be gathered together 
from the parts of the chain thus formed? 

8. Two-hundred students are positioned in 10 rows, each containing 
20 students. From each of the 20 columns thus formed the shortest 
student is selected, and the tallest of these 20 (short) students is 
tagged A. These students now return to their initial places. Next 
the tallest student in each row is selected, and from these 10 (tall) 
students the shortest is tagged B. Which of the two tagged students 
is the taller (if they are different people)? 

9. Given thirteen gears, each weighing an integral number of 
grams. It is known that any twelve of them may be placed on a 
pan balance, six on each pan, in such a way that the scale will be 
in equilibrium. Prove that all the gears must be of equal weight.

Problems (7-13) 9 

Each number is the sum of three numbers of the previous row: the 
number immediately above it and the numbers immediately to the 
right and left of that one. If no number appears in one or more of 
these locations, the number zero is used. Prove that every row, 
beginning with the third row, contains at least one even number. 

11. Twelve squares are laid out in a circular pattern [as on the 
circumference of a circle]. Four different colored chips, red, yellow, 
green, blue, are placed on four consecutive squares. A chip may be 
moved in either a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction over four 
other squares to a fifth square, provided that the fifth square is not 
occupied by a chip. After a certain number of moves the same four 
squares will again be occupied by chips. How many permutations 
(rearrangements) of the four chips are possible as a result of this 
process? 

12. An island is inhabited by five men and a pet monkey. One 
afternoon the men gathered a large pile of coconuts, which they 
proposed to divide equally among themselves the next morning. 
During the night one of the men awoke and decided to help himself 
to his share of the nuts. In dividing them into five equal parts he 
found that there was one nut left over. This one he gave to the 
monkey. He then hid his one-fifth share, leaving the rest in a single 
pile. Later during the night another man awoke with the same idea 
in mind. He went to the pile, divided it into five equal parts, and 
found that there was one coconut left over. This he gave to the 
monkey, and then he hid his one-fifth share, restoring the rest to 
one pile. During the same night each of the other three men arose, 
one at a time, and in ignorance of what had happened previously, 
went to the pile, and followed the same procedure. Each time one 
coconut was left over, and it was given to the monkey. The next 
morning all five men went to the diminished nut pile and divided it 
into five equal parts, finding that one nut remained over. What is 
the least number of coconuts the original pile could have contained? 

13. Two brothers sold a herd of sheep which they owned. For 
each sheep they received as many rubles as the number of sheep 
originally in the herd. The money was then divided in the follow¬ 
ing manner. First, the older brother took ten rubles, then the 
younger brother took ten rubles, after which the older brother took 
another ten rubles, and so on. At the end of the division the younger 
brother, whose turn it was, found that there were fewer than ten

rubles left, so he took what remained. To make the division just, 
the older brother gave the younger his penknife. How much was 
the penknife worth?

mean of the digits 0,1,2, ***,9 (this shows that the “greater” and

first few decimal fractions may contain the same number of digits 
in their periods, but the subsequent decimal fractions of the sequence 
will all have p times as many digits in their periods as has the 
preceding term.

From problem (a) it follows that in the sequence of numbers (1 + 1/2) 2 , 
(1 + 1/3) 3 , ••■,(! + l/tt) n , ■*■, each is greater than that preceding. Since, on 
the other hand, no member of the sequence exceeds 3 (see problem 145), it 
follows that if n -+ «>, the magnitude of (1 + 1 /n) n approaches some definite 
limit (which is evidently a number between 2 and 3). This limiting number is 
designated by e. It is equal, approximately, to 2.718281828459045* . 

Analogously, problem 149 (b) shows that in the sequence (1 + 1/2) 3 , (1 + 1/3) 4 , 
(1 -I- 1/4) 5 , •■■,(! + l/n) n+1 , ■ * * every number is less than that preceding. Since 
every number of the sequence exceeds 1, the magnitude (1 + 1 jn) n+1 , where n 
increases without bound, tends toward some limiting number. The numbers 
of the second sequence then become successively closer and closer to the 
numbers of the first [that is, the ratios (1 + l/ti) 7J+1 : (1 + l/n) n = 1 + l/n become 
closer and closer to 1]. Hence, the limiting number must, in the second case, 
also be equal to e. This number, e, plays a very important role in higher 
mathematics, and is encountered in a wide variety of problems (see, for ex¬ 
ample, problems 156 and 159). 


150. Prove that, for any integer w, the following inequality holds, 



n 

< nl < n 



n 


where e = 2.71828- ■ • is the limit of (1 -b 1 ln) n as n — > oo. 

This result is an extension of the result of problem 148. It follows, in par¬ 
ticular, that for any two numbers, ai and « 2 , such that a\ < e < ai (for ex¬ 
ample, for ai = 2.7 and az = 2.8; for oi = 2.71 and cli = 2.72; for ai = 2.718 and 
az = 2.719, and so on) for all integers n which are “large enough" (greater 
than some integer N, where the magnitude of N depends on what «i we con¬ 
sider), the following inequality holds: 



)“>*!> 



Thus, the number e is that limitig number which separates the numbers a for 
which ( n/ay 1 exceeds, or “dominates," n\ from those numbers a for which the 
(nja) n are “dominated” by nl. (The existence of such a limiting number 
follows from problem 148.) 

Actually, {njaz) n < nl for every n exceeding 6 [if az > e, and if n > 6, in 
view of problem 150, nl > ( n/e ) B ]. Further, from the results of problems 145 
and 149, it follows that, for n ^ 3, the following inequalities hold:

r n > K« + l; 

consequently, for n ^ 3, Vn diminishes as n increases. It is readily seen 
that if n becomes very large, v / n approaches as close to unity as we wish. 
It follows, for example, that log X ^V 10* — kj 10*, for sufficiently large k , can 
be made as small as we wish. Let us now select an N such that the inequality 
SI? < e/at holds. Then for n > N the approximation S n. < e/at is still 
more improved, and from problem 150 it follows that 


The inequality of problem 150 admits a great deal of precision. It is possible 
to show that for sufficiently large n the number n\ is approximated by 
Cv / n ( n/e) n , where C is a constant equal to v / 2n :

for the solution of the cubic equation

Remark'. This result enables us to solve any equation of the third degree. 
Let 

x 3 + Ax 2 + Bx + C = 0 

be any cubic equation (the coefficient of a: 3 is taken as 1, since in any other 
case we can divide through by the coefficient of x 3 ). We make the substitution 


x = y + c , 


and we obtain 


y 3 + 3 cy 2 + 3c 2 y + c 3 + A(y z -f 2 cy + c 2 ) + B(y + c) + C = 0 ,

y 3 + (3 c + A)y 2 + (3c 2 + 2 Ac + B)y + (c 3 + Ac 2 + Be + C) = 0 .

COMPLEX NUMBERS 


In many of the problems in this section the following formulas are 
useful. 

(1) The formula for the product of complex numbers in trigonometric form: 

(cos a + i sin a)(cos /3 + i sin ft) = cos (a + 0) + i sin (a + &) . 

(2) De Moivre’s formula: 

(cos a + i sin a) n = cos na + i sin na 

(where n is a natural number), which is an n-fold application of the previous 
formula. 

(3) The formula for the roots of complex numbers: 

n,- : — : - a+ 360°-A . . a + 360° -A 

v cos a + % sin a = cos-h % sin- 

n n 

(A = 0, 1,2, 1) , 

which is an extended form of De Moivre’s theorem. 

In particular, a large role is played in the following problems by the formula 
for the wth rooths of unity, that is, the roots of the nth-degree equation 

x n - 1 = 0 , 

which are given by the following formulas:

Problems ( 222-225 )

The following observation will often be useful in solving the problems of 
this section. Let the equation of degree n, 

x n + aix n ~ l + aix n ~ 2 + * • - + a n -ix + a» = 0 , 
have the n roots xi, x 2 , ■ - •, x n -u x n . Then the left member of the equation is 
divisible by (x — xi)(x — x 2 )’ ■ *(x — x n )\ that is, 

x n + aiX ll ~ l + ■ • * + a n -ix + a n = (x - Xi)(x - xz) - * *(x - x n -i)(x - Xn) . 

If we multiply out the second member of this equation and equate coefficients 
of like powers of x from both members, we obtain the following formulas giving 
relationships between the coefficients on the left and the roots of the equation 
(Vieta's formulas).

SOME PROBLEMS OF 
NUMBER THEORY 


These problems are concerned with that division of mathematics treating 
properties of integers, Elementary Number Theory. Many of the problems in 
other sections of this book also deal with number theory—particularly Sections 
3, 4, and 5. Several of the following theorems, stated here as problems, play 
an important role in number theory (see, for example, problems 240, 241, 245- 
247, 249, 253). Clearly, these problems do not pretend to explore with any 
completeness the rich variety of methods and ideas that have permeated this 
discipline, which is at once one of the most fruitful and one of the most dif¬ 
ficult of all mathematical endeavors. A good systematic account of some parts 
of number theory is given in the book by B. B. Dynkin and V. A. Uspensky, 
Mathematical Conversations, Issue 6, Library of the USSR Mathematical Society. 
There the reader will find alternate solutions to some of the problems of this 
section. An excellent condensed treatment is the article by A. Y. Khinchin, 
“Elementary Number Theory," appearing in the Encyclopedia of Elementary 
Mathematics, Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1951, which 
contains, as an appendix, an extensive bibliography covering the topics touched 
on in the article. 

240. Fermat's Theorem. Prove that if p is a prime number, then 
the difference a p — a is, for any integer a, divisible by p. 

Remark : Problems 27 (a)-(d) are special cases of this theorem. 

241. Euler's Theorem. Let N be any natural number and let r 

56 


be the number of integers in the sequence 1,2,3, 1 which 

are relatively prime to N. Prove that if a is any integer which is 
relatively prime to N, then a r — 1 is divisible by N. 

Remark : If the number N is prime, then all the integers of the sequence 
are, of course, relatively prime to N\ that is, r = N — 1. In this case, Euler s 
theorem assumes the form a^ -1 — 1 is divisible by N, if N is prime. It is 
clear that Fermat’s theorem (problem 240) can be considered a special case of 
Euler's theorem. 

If N = p", where p is a prime number, then of the first N — 1 = p n — 1 
positive integers, those not relatively prime to N= p n will be p, 2p, 3p, ■**, 
A 1 — p - ( p n ~ l - l)p, Therefore, we have r = ( p n - 1) - (p ” _1 — 1) = p” — p n ~ l , 
and Euler's theorem provides the following corollary: The difference 
ati n- P n-i _ ^ where p is prime and a is not divisible by p, is divisible by p n . 

If N = p^pf 2 - • -Pfc fc , where pi, p 2 , ■ • •, p* are distinct primes, then the number 
r of prime numbers less than N and relatively prime to N is given by the 
formula 



(See, for example, the article by A. Y. Khinchin, referred to above.) If N = p n 
is a power of the prime p, this formula yields 



which is the result obtained previously. 

242. * According to Euler's theorem, the difference 2 k — 1, where 
k = 5 n - 5 71 ” 1 , is divisible by 5" (see problem 241, and the remark 
following it). Prove that there exists no k less than 5* — 5 n_1 such 
that 2 fc — 1 is divisible by 5”. 

243. Let us write, in order, the consecutive powers of the number 
2: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, ■ ■ Note that in 
this sequence the final digits periodically repeat with a period of 4: 

2,4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6,2,4, 8, 6, ■ ■ • . 

Prove that, if we begin at a suitable point of the sequence, the last 
ten digits of the numbers of the sequence will also repeat periodically. 
Find the length of the period and the number of integers in the 
sequence for which this observed periodicity occurs. 

244. * Prove that there exists some power of 2 whose final 1000 
digits are all ones and twos. 

245. Wilson's Theorem . Prove that: if the integer p is prime, 


58 


59 


Some Problems in Number Theory 

then the number (/> — 1)! -H 1 is divisible by p\ if p is composite, 
then (p — 1)! + 1 is not divisible by p . 

246. * Let p be a prime number which yields the remainder 1 upon 
division by 4. Prove that there exists an integer x such that x z + 1 
is divisible by p. 

247. ** Prove the following. 

(a) If each of the two integers A and B can be represented 
as the sum of two squares, then their product A*B can also be re¬ 
presented in this manner. 

(b) All prime numbers of form 4n + 1 can be written as 
the sum of two squares, and no number of form 4n + 3 can be so 
expressed. 

(c) A composite number N can be written as the sum of 
two squares if and only if all its prime factors of form 4n + 3 oc¬ 
cur an even number of times. 

For example, the numbers 10,000 = 2 4 -5 4 and 2430 = 2 2 -3 z *5-13 can 
be represented as the sum of the squares of two integers (in the first 
number there are no factors of form 4 n + 3, and in the second 
number there is one such factor, 3, which occurs twice); the number 
2002 = 2*7*11 -13 cannot be represented as the sum of two squares 
(the factors 7 and 11, of form 4 n + 3, appear once). 

248. Prove that, for any prime p , it is possible to find integers x 
and y such that x 2 + y z + 1 is divisible by p. 

249. ** Prove the following. 

(a) If each of two numbers A and B can be written as the 
sum of the squares of four integers, then their product A B can 
also be represented in this manner, 

(b) Every natural number can be written as the sum of not 
more than four squares. 

example, 35 = 25 + 9 + 1 = 5 2 + 3* + l 2 ; 60 = 49 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 7 2 + 
3 3 + l 2 + l 2 ; 1000 = 900 + 100 = 30 2 + 10 2 , and so on.

can be a square or the sum of two squares or three squares of 
integers. 

Remark : It has been shown that every integer which cannot be written in 
form 4 ^(Sk — 1) is representable as the sum of three or fewer squares. How¬ 
ever, the proof is very complicated. 

251. ** Prove that every positive integer can be written as the 
sum of not more than 53 fourth powers of integers. 

Remark : Experimental trials indicate that integers of moderate size are 
representable as the sum of far fewer fourth powers than 53, To the present 
time, no integer has been produced which cannot be given as the sum of 19, 
or fewer, fourth powers. (Of the numbers less than 100, only one—the number 
79—requires as many as 19 fourth powers; that is four terms of 2* and 15 units). 
It has been conjectured that 19 fourth powers suffice for every integer, but no 
proof of this has as yet appeared. The best result in this direction has been 
the proof that every natural number can be written as the sum of not more 
than 21 fourth powers. This is a substantial improvement over the proposition 
given as problem 251, but the proof of it involves considerable higher mathe¬ 
matics. 

In problem 239 (b) it was stated that every integer can be written as the 
sum of not more than four squares. It has also been shown that every integer 
can be written as the sum of not more than nine cubes. 

All these propositions are embraced by the following remarkable theorem: 
For every positive integer k there exists a positive integer N ( depending , of 
course, on k) stick that every mteger may be written as the sum of not more 
than N /cth powers of positive integers. This theorem has been provided with 
several different proofs, but only recently has a proof been given which does 
not require considerable higher mathematics. In 1942 the Soviet mathematician 
U. V. Linnik gave the elementary proof. This proof is presented in the popular 
little book by A. Y. Khinchin, Three Pearls of Number Theory , Government 
Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1949. r Although Linnik’s proof is ele¬ 
mentary, it is not easy reading. Khinchin himself remarks that almost any¬ 
body can understand it with “only two or three weeks work with pencil and 
paper.’’ 

252. ** Prove that every positive rational number (in particular, 
every positive integer) can be written as the sum of three cubes of 
positive rational numbers. 

Remark: Not all positive rational numbers can be represented as the sum 
of two cubes of positive rational numbers. Consider, for example, the number

Remark: The following more general theorem holds: If the first term of 
an infinite arithmetic progression of integers is relatively prime to the com¬ 
mon difference , the progression contains an in finite number of primes. How¬ 
ever, the proof of this theorem is quite complicated. (It is interesting that an 
elementary, albeit very difficult, proof of this classical theorem of number 
theory was published for the first time only in 1952 by the Danish mathema¬ 
tician Selberg. Prior to this the only known proofs involved higher mathematics).

SOME DISTINCTIVE INEQUALITIES 


This section presents several problems relating to inequalities stemming from 
two important inequalities which play a major role in mathematical analysis 
and in geometry. These are the theorem relating arithmetic and geometric 
means (problem 268), and the so-called Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality (problem 
289). Many problems on inequalities, not related to these two but of importance 
in other applications, appear in other sections of this book (see, in particular, 
Sections 6 and 7). 

A great many interesting inequalities may be found in the Problem Book in 
Algebra , by V. A. Kretchmer, Government Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 
1950, where an entire chapter is devoted to inequalities. That book offers 
alternative proofs of several of the inequalities presented here. There is also 
much interesting material in the books by P. P. Korovkin, Inequalities (Govern¬ 
ment Technical Publishing House, Moscow, 1951), by G. L. Nevyashy, In¬ 
equalities (Pedagogical Publishing House, Moscow, 1947), and particularly that 
by Hardy, Littlewood, and Polya, Inequalities , (Government Technical Publish¬ 
ing House, Moscow, 1949).T 

The initial chapters of the last book may be read by persons not acquainted 
with higher mathematics' 

The following problems are not presented in order of increasing difficulty. 

t The last book was originally written in English. It is published by Cam¬ 
bridge University Press, revised edition, [Editor],

Some Distinctive Inequalities 


The ordering is such that in some instances the result of one problem will be 
useful in solving the next; in other instances problems conceptually related are 
grouped together. The simplest properties of inequalities are assumed known. 

In all the problems of this section, small English letters designate real 
numbers. 


Theorems on Arithmetic and Geometric Means and Their Applications 

We know, from formal mathematics courses, that the geometric mean of two 
positive numbers a and 6 is less than, or equal to, their arithmetic mean, 

y'aS g - + - , (1) 

and the equality holds only if a = 6. This is proved as follows. 

If we square both members of the inequality and clear of fractions, we arrive 
at 

4a6 ^ (a + 6) 2 . 

Expanding the right member, transposing 4 ab to the right side, and so on, we 
obtain 

0 ^ a 2 - 2ab + 6 2 = (a - 6) 2 , 

which clearly is true for all numbers a and 6, since the square of any real 
number is nonnegative. 

Hence, inequality (1) holds for every real number. Moreover, it is evident 
that (a — 6) 2 can be zero only if a = 6; that is, the last inequality reduces to 
the equality only for a = 6, Therefore, this criterion must hold also for in¬ 
equality (1). 

Inequality (1) may be rewritten in the following equivalent form, which we 
shall use hereafter: 

/ a + & V a 2 + 6 2 




If we expand the left member of (l’) r clear of fractions and put all terms in 
the right member, we obtain 

0 ^ 2a 2 + 2& 2 - (a 2 + 2a& + & 2 ) = (a - 6) 2 . 

Use of inequalities ( 1 ) and (1') simplifies the solution of the first of the prob¬ 
lems which follow. These two forms of the inequality are useful in the deri¬

Arithmetic and Geometric Means

It is easy to see that Si(a) = A(a) and S~i(a) = H(a). 

if a = 0, the expression for Sec is meaningless. On the other hand, it can 
be proved that if a -> 0, then S«(a) tends to the geometric mean T(a).t There¬ 
fore, it is convenient to define Sa(a) — r(a). (An additional justification for 
this definition is given in problem 282.) The power mean of order 2 is referred 
to as the quadratic mean . 

Inequality (l f ) (see the remark at the beginning of this section) can now be 
stated as follows: The arithmetic mean of two numbers does not exceed their 
quadratic mean (and the equality holds only if the numbers are equal).

does not exceed the quadratic mean:

arithmetic mean of n positive numbers does not exceed their power 
mean of order k :

Some Distinctive Inequalities 


282. Prove that the power mean of order a of n positive numbers, 
for a > 0, is not less than the geometric mean, and, for a < 0, is 
not greater than the geometric mean (equality holds only if all n 
numbers are equal.) 

Remark : The theorems of problems 268 and 270 are particular cases of this 
proposition.

power mean of order a does not exceed the power mean of order

(b) The sum of the squares of three positive numbers is 
equal to 18. What is the smallest possible value for the sum of the 
cubes of these numbers? What is the smallest possible value for 
the sum of these numbers? 

The symmetric mean of order k of n positive numbers auai, (where 

A: is a natural number not exceeding n) is defined to be the A:th root of the 
sum of all possible products of these n numbers taken k at a time:

The Cauchy-Buniakowski Inequality 

The following elementary inequality is readily verified: 

aibi + aibi ^ y/ af + dtf b\ + 62 
or, 

(di&i + CI2&2) 2 ^ (fl'i + + ^2) * ( 1 ) 

Expanding both sides and collecting all terms on one side we obtain 

(ai &2 — a,zbi) 2 ^ 0 . 

It follows that inequality (1) becomes an equality if 

aj>z = d2&i , 

that is, if 


fll __ d2

Inequality (1) yields a significant generalization which is important in in¬ 
equality theory and has useful applications in mathematics and physics.t

DIFFERENCE SEQUENCES AND SUMS 


Consider the sequence of numbers 

Uo, Ul , Uly • • U n , • ■ • . 

The first difference sequence of this sequence is the set of numbers 

Wq 1 — Wi uq ; 

= ui — ui ; 

Wg 1 ’ = uz — uz ;

a sequence of zeros: 0, 0, 0, 0, ■ * *. If the initial sequence is the set of squares 
of integers, 1,4,9, 16, 25, 36, 49, - ■ *, then the differences of first order form the 
sequence of odd numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ■ ■ the differences of second order 
form the sequence 2, 2, 2, 2, and the third sequence (differences of third 
order) consists of zeros. [In the examples investigated we quickly arrived at 
a sequence of zeros, and this is related to the general proposition of 309 (b).] 
The sequences of differences of a finite sequence of numbers can be con¬ 
veniently written in triangular array : 



Here it is apparent that each number is the difference of the two adjacent 
numbers of the row above. For an infinite sequence of numbers the triangular 
(infinite) array has the form 



In a fashion analogous to finding the successive sequences of differences of 
a set of numbers we can also define sequences of sums. The sequence of

completed at any moment. This must be an even number, since every 
handshake is participated in by two people, thus the total number 
is increased by two. The number of handshakes, however, is also 
the sum of the handshakes made by each individual person Since 
this sum is an even number, the count of the people who have shaken 
hands an odd number of times must be even (otherwise, odd times

chessboard in 63 moves: the initial and final squares are the same 


3. (a) Let us denote the minimum number of transfers necessary 
to construct a pyramid consisting of n rings on the second peg (under 
80 


the conditions given by the problem) by kin). Clearly, &(1) = 1. 
Further, if n = 2, then to transfer the second ring to the second peg, 
we must first transfer the first ring from the second peg to the auxil¬ 
iary peg; then we place the second ring on the second peg and 
transfer the first (smallest) ring to the second peg. Thus, k{2) = 3. 
If n — 3, then to transfer the lowest (largest) ring to the second peg, 
in the necessary arrangement, we must first move the two rings al¬ 
ready on the second peg to the auxiliary peg. This requires k(2) 
moves, and k(2) moves will be required again to replace the rings on 
the second peg after the largest ring is moved from the first peg to 
the second peg. Thus, 

k(3) = 2k{2) + 1=7. 

In an analogous way find 

6(4) = 2*(3) + 1 = 15; 

*(5) = 2A(4) + 1 = 31 . 

In general, 

kin) = 2 k{n - 1) + 1 . 

Noting that, for example, 6(3) = 2 3 — 1, 6(4) = 2 4 — 1, and so on, we 
assume as an induction hypothesis that kin — 1) = 2 n_1 — 1. Then 

kin) = 2 kin - 1) + 1 = 2(2 n_1 - 1) + 1 = 2" - 1 . 

Thus, by the principle of finite mathematical induction, it follows 
that kin) — 2 n — 1 for all n. 

(b) Designated by Kin) the least number of moves necessary to 
remove n rings from the rod. From the beginning position it is pos¬ 
sible to remove either the first ring [see Figure 5(a)] or the second 
[Figure 5(b)]; consequently, Ki 1) = 1 and Ki2) = 2 (for two rings, we 
first remove the second ring, then the first). 

In order to remove the ith ring it is necessary to remove the i — 2 
preceding rings; otherwise the ith ring cannot be moved to the end 
of the rod. On the other hand, if the H — l)st ring is already removed, 
then the ith ring cannot be removed [see Figure 6(a)] (it is evident 
that if three rings are removed, then the fourth cannot be removed). 
But if the ii — l)st ring is removed, then the (i + l)st ring can easily 
be removed [see Figure 6(b) and (c)]. 

Now it is not difficult to answer the question posed by the problem. 
In order to remove the last of the n rings it is first necessary to 
remove the first n — 2 rings. This can be done in Kin — 2) moves,

after this the final ring can be taken off in one more move. It then 
remains to remove the (n — l)st ring. We will designate by k(n) the 
number of moves necessary to remove only the nth ring, under the 
condition that all the preceding rings have already been taken off. 
We obtain 


K(n) = K(n — 2) -f 1 -f k(n — 1) . 

We shall now find an expression for the number k(ri)> Clearly, in 
order to remove the nth ring from the rod we must put the (n — l)st 
ring back on the rod. This can be done in k(n — 1) moves [the same 
number of moves which were necessary to remove the (n — 1) st ring 
from the rod, the moves now being done in reverse order]. The nth 
ring is now easily removed from the rod, requiring only one addi¬ 
tional move. Finally, the (n — l)st ring must be taken off the rod, 
for which k(n — 1) more moves are needed. Thus, we obtain 



k(n) — 2 k(n — 1) -h 1 ,

Now the formula which determines K(n) takes the form

4. (a) We divide the coins into three groups: two having 27 coins 
each and one having 26 coins. A first weight trial is made by plac¬ 
ing a group of 27 coins on each of the two pans. If the pans do not 
balance, the counterfeit coin is among those in the lighter pan. If 
the scale is in balance, the counterfeit coin is among the 26 un¬ 
weighed coins. Therefore, it suffices to solve the following problem: 
To find, by three weight trials, a light counterfeit coin among 27 
coins (the problem of detecting the counterfeit in the group of 26 coins 
can be reduced to this by simply adding to the set of 26 coins a 
genuine coin from the 54 which were weighed). 

For a second weight trial we divide the 27 coins into three groups 
of nine each and place a group of nine coins on each of the two pans. 
This will reveal which group of nine coins contains the counterfeit. 
The group of nine coins containing the counterfeit is then divided 
into three groups of three coins each. A third weight trial will tell 
which group of three coins contains the counterfeit. Finally, a fourth 
weight trial involving two of the three doubtful coins will reveal the 
counterfeit. 

(b) Let He a natural number which satisfies the inequalities 


3* ^ n and 3*- 1 < n. We shall show that the number k satisfies the 
conditions of the problem. 

First we show that, at most, k weight trials are enough to allow 
detection of the counterfeit coin. We divide the coins into three 
groups such that in each of two equal groups there are 3* -1 (or fewer) 
coins and the number of coins in the third group does not exceed 
3 t_I (this is possible for n S 3*). The two groups having the same 
number of coins are placed on the pans of the balance; this enables 
us to determine which group contains the counterfeit [see the solu¬ 
tion to problem (a)]. If the group containing the counterfeit coin 
contains fewer than 3 k l coins, we add to it enough (genuine) coins 
from the other two groups to give it 3*" 1 coins. This group of 3 k ~ l 
coins containing the counterfeit is again divided into three groups, 
as before, and a second weight trial is made, as before. The pro¬ 
cedure is continued until after, at most, k weight trials we arrive at 
a group containing only one coin—that is, we have located the counter¬ 
feit coin. 

It is now necessary to show that k is the minimal number of weight 
trials which will guarantee the detection of the counterfeit coin under 
all circumstances. (Note: We might, under certain circumstances, 
succeed with fewer weight trials. For example, if two coins are 
chosen at random and compared, we might be fortunate enough to 
have chosen the counterfeit coin as one of them. However, this does 
not give us a procedure by which we can be sure, under all possible 
circumstances, of detecting the counterfeit by the required number 
of weight trials.) 

In each weight trial, as outlined above, the coins are divided into 
three groups, two of which are placed on each of the two pans, and 
the third being the unweighed group. If with an equal number of 
coins on each pan the scale balances, then, of course, the counter¬ 
feit is in the third group. If the pans are out of balance, we know 
that the counterfeit is on one of the pans, although a prior knowledge 
as to whether the counterfeit is lighter or heavier than the rest is 
needed to tell us on which of the two pans it lies. 

Let us assume that in an arbitrary sequence of weight trials the 
result of each weighing is least favorable with respect to enabling us 
to detect the counterfeit coin; that is the counterfeit is always in 
that group of three which contains the largest number of coins. 
Then upon each weight trial the number of coins in the group 
which contains the counterfeit will not be less than ^ the to¬ 
tal number of coins (that is, upon division of the coins into three 


™ Introductory Problems 

groups, one of the groups must contain not fewer than 3 of them). 
Then after k - 1 weight trials the number of coins in the group 
containing the counterfeit will be not less than and, since 

n>3 k ~ l , the counterfeit will not be found by k - 1 weight trials. 

Remark-. It can be shown that the answer to the problem can be expressed 
in the following form: The minimal number of weight trials necessary to de¬ 
tect the one counterfeit coin in a collection of n coins is [log 3 (n - 4]) + 1, where 
the brackets designate “the largest integer in the number’’ (see the note just 
prior to problem 101). 

5. One block is placed on each pan (first weight trial). There are 
two possible outcomes: 

Oh the first weight trial one of the pans is heavier . In this event 
one of the blocks must be aluminum and the other duraluminum. We 
now place both blocks on one pan and weigh them against pairs of 
remaining blocks (those being divided into nine pairs arbitrarily). 
Any pair of blocks which outweighs the first pair must consist of 
two duraluminum blocks. If the first pair is the heavier, then both 
blocks of the second pair are alminum. If both pairs balance, the 
second pair contains one aluminum and one duraluminum block. 
Thus, for this first event the number of duraluminum blocks can be 
determined by at most ten weight trials. 

On the first weight trial the pans balance . In this event both blocks 
are aluminum or both are duraluminum. As before, we now place 
both blocks on one pan and weigh them against pairs of remaining 
blocks. Assume that the first k pairs of blocks from the nine pairs 
have the same weight as the test blocks, and that the (k + l)st pair 
tested have a different weight. (If k = 9, then all the blocks weigh 
the same, and so there are no duraluminum blocks. The event in 
which k = 0 falls into the general case.) Suppose, for definiteness, 
that the (k + l)st pair is heavier than the test blocks [the reasoning 
which follows will be quite analogous if the (k + l)st pair is lighter]. 
Then the original two blocks, as well as all those of the first k pairs 
tested, must be aluminum. Therefore, in the 1 + (k + 1) = k + 2 
weight trials already made we have found k + 1 pairs of aluminum 
blocks. Now we compare the two blocks of the (k + l)st (heavier) 
pair. [This is the (k + 3)rd weight trial.] If both blocks are of the 
same weight, they must both be duraluminum; if they are not of 
the same weight, one is aluminum and the other is duraluminum. 
In either event we are able, after £ + 3 weight trials, to display a 
pair of blocks of which one is aluminum and the other duraluminum. 


Solutions (5-6) 87 

By using this pair we can determine in, at most, 8 — k weight trials 
how many duraluminum blocks remain among the 20 — 2(k + 2) = 
16 — 2k unweighed ones, using the technique employed in the first 
event. The number of weight trials used in this second event is then 
equal to k + 3 + (8 — k) = 11. 

6. (a) Divide the coins into three sets of four coins each. For a 
first weight trial we place a group of four coins on each pan. There 
are two possibilities, which we shall investigate separately: 

(1) The pans balance. 

(2) One pan outweighs the other. 

The pans balance. In this event the counterfeit coin is in the un¬ 
weighed set, and all eight coins on the scale are genuine. We num¬ 
ber the coins of the doubtful group 1,2, 3, 4. We carry out second 
weight trial by placing coins 1, 2, and 3 on one pan and placing the other 
three coins now known to be genuine on the other pan. There are 
two possibilities: 

(A) The pans are in balance. In this event coin 4 is the counter¬ 
feit. A third weighing, comparing coin 4 with a genuine one, will 
tell whether it is lighter or heavier. 

(B) One pan is heavier. In this event the counterfeit is one of 
coins 1,2, or 3. If the genuine coins are the heavier, then the 
counterfeit is a light coin, and vice-versa. One more weight trial 
will identify which of coins 1,2, or 3 is a light coin, hence counter¬ 
feit [see the solution to problem 4(a)]. If the pan containing coins 
1,2, and 3 is the heavier, then the counterfeit coin is heavier than 
a genuine one. One weight trial will identify it. 

Oyie pan outweighs the other. In this event all the other coins are 
genuine. Let us designate the coins on the heavier pan by the num¬ 
bers 1,2, 3,4 (if one of these coins is false, then it is heavier than 
the others) and the coins on the lighter pan by 1', 2', 3', 4' (if one of 
these coins is false, then it is lighter than the others). A second 
weight trial is made by placing coins, 1,2, and T on one pan and 
coins 3, 4, and 2' on the other. Again, there are several possibilities: 

(A) The pans balance. In this event the counterfeit coin is either 
3' or 4' (and is lighter than a genuine coin). A third weight trial is 
made by placing coin 3' on one pan and coin 4 / on the other; the 
lighter coin will be the counterfeit. 

(B) The pan containing coins 1, 2, and 1' is heavier. In this event 
coins 3,4, and V are genuine; were either coin 3 or coin 4 heavier 
than the others, or were coin 1' light, then in the second weight 



88 


Introductory Problems 


trial the pan containing coins 3, 4, and 2' would have been heavy, 
which was not the result for this case. Therefore, the counterfeit 
coin is either coin 1 or coin 2 (and it is a heavier coin), or else it is 
coin 2' (and it is a lighter coin). A third weight trial is made, plac¬ 
ing coin 1 on one pan and coin 2 on the other. If the pans balance, 
then the counterfeit coin is 2'. If the pans fail to balance, then the 
counterfeit coin is on the heavier pan. 

(C) The pan containing coins 3, 4, and 2' is heavier. Reasoning 
as before, we conclude that coins 1, 2, and 2' are genuine and that 
if one of the coins 3 or 4 is counterfeit, then it is a heavier coin 
than the others, and if coin 1' is the counterfeit, then it is lighter. 
A third weighing is made by placing coin 3 on one pan and coin 4 
on the other. If the pans balance, then the counterfeit is T; if, on 
the other hand, one pan is heavier, then it contains the counterfeit 
coin. 

(b) We shall prove in three stages, (A), (B), (C), that if the num- 
3* — 3 

ber of coins is A ^ —-—, then the counterfeit coin can be detected 
(and determined to be heavy or light) by n weight trials, and if 

3 n — 3 

A > —-—, then n weighings do not necessarily suffice (see the hint 

to this problem). We shall solve first the following related problem, 
applying relaxed conditions. 

(A) Suppose we are given A coins, divided into two groups, which 
we shall designate X and Y (we do not exclude the possibility that 
one of the groups contains no coins). We assume that one of the N 
coins is counterfeit, and also that if the counterfeit is in the X group, 
then it is lighter than all the others, but if it is in group Y then it 
is heavier than all the others. We must show that if N ^ 3 n , then 
the counterfeit coin can be detected by means of n weight trials on a 
pan balance , and if N > 3 n , then this is not always possible f If group 
Y contains no coins, the problem becomes as follows. There is one 
counterfeit coin among N coins, and it is lighter than the others; to 
prove: that if N ^ 3\ then the counterfeit can be found by n weight 
trials on a pan balance, and if N > 3 n , then this is not always pos¬ 
sible; see problem 4(b).) 

The proof will be given by mathematical induction. First we show 
that if N ^ 3*, the counterfeit can always be detected by n weight 
trials. If n = 1, that is if = 1,2, or 3, the proposition is quite 

t This statement has one obvious exception: If AT = 2 and groups X and Y 
each contains one coin, then, of course, the counterfeit coin cannot be detected.

obvious (except as noted in the preceding footnote). For example, 
if A = 3, then it suffices to compare two of the coins from one group. 
Assume now that it has been shown that if A ^ 3"' 1 , then the counter¬

If the pans balance, the counterfeit coin is among the N — 2(x + y) 
coins which were not placed on the scale; if one of the pans is hea¬ 
vier, the counterfeit is either among the * coins of group X on the 
lighter pan, or among the y coins of group Y on the heavier pan. 
But according to the induction hypothesis we can, in either event, 
find the counterfeit coin by conducting n — 1 additional weight trials 
[since both TV - 2{x + y) and (x + y) fail to exceed 3 B -‘]. f This pro¬ 
ves, by induction, that if TV g 3", then n weight trials suffice for find¬ 
ing the counterfeit. 

We now prove that if TV >3", then the counterfeit cannot, in 
general, be detected by n weight trials. (By “in general” we mean 
that there simply does not exist a sure program which will always 
locate the false coin in n trials. There is always the possibility, for 
example, that if we select two coins at random, one of them might 
be the counterfeit; but we are not concerned with this sort of ac¬ 
cidental success.) For this proof we make an additional assumption to 
relax our conditions. We assume that in addition to the two sets X 
and Y of coins, together containing TV > 3” coins, we have at our dis¬ 
posal a quantity of coins all known to be genuine. We designate this 
last group of coins by Z (how many there are is not important). We 
shall show, by using these auxiliary coins, that the counterfeit can¬ 
not, in general, be found by n weight trials. 

It is easily verified that if n = 1 (that is, if the total number TV of 
coins in X and Y exceeds 3), then one weighing will not always suf-

us to find the counterfeit by one weighing.

fice to locate the counterfeit coin. Assume now that it has been 
proved that if the number N of coins in groups X and Y exceeds 3*-> 
then it is not, in general, possible to detect the counterfeit by „-{ 
weight trials. We must show, then, that in this event if N> 3\ the 
counterfeit cannot always be detected in n weight trials. Suppose 
that m the first weight trial we have placed on the first pan x coins 
from group X, y coins from group Y, and 2 coins from auxiliary 
group Z, and that we have put on the other pan x' coins from group 
X and / coins from group Y, so that x + y + z = x ' + y' (clearly it 
would be useless to put coins from Z on both pans). Let w be the 

number of coins of groups X and Y which have been left off the 
scale { x + x' + y+ y' + w = N) _ Now the scale may be in balance> 

the counterfeit is among those coins not placed on the scale. If w 
exceeds 3”- 1 , then, by our induction hypothesis, n - 1 additional 
weighings will not, in general, suffice to locate the counterfeit there, 
and we will already have used up one weight trial. Thus, on the 
first weight trial, in order to guarantee even the possibility that n

x + y + x'+y' = N — 3" _1 > 3* — 3™- 1 = 2* 3 ™- 1 . 

If the pans do not balance, the imbalance is caused either by a light 
counterfeit in the X group or by a heavy counterfeit in the Y group. 
Hence, we must deal with either a group of x + y' coins (if the pan 
with x + y + z coins is lighter) or a group of x' + y doubtful coins. 
But according to the relation x + y + x ' + y' > 2-3— 1 , the larger of 
the numbers x+y' and x' + y exceeds 3->. We must be prepared 
to deal with this larger number of coins, and according to the in¬ 
duction hypothesis n - 1 additional weight trials will not always 
suffice to identify the counterfeit. This induction completes the proof 
of case (A). 

(B) Suppose we are given N coins containing one counterfeit which 
differs in weight from the others, but that we do not know whether 
the counterfeit is lighter or heavier. Assume we have available an

the counterfeit can always be detected by n weight trials ; the counter¬

N given coins together with the extra genuine coin, and we place on 
the other pan x + 1 coins. There remain N — 2x — l unweighed 
coins. We choose the number x to satisfy the requirement

counterfeit coin by making not more than n — 1 additional weight 
trials. If the pans do not balance, then the x coins on one pan and 
the x + 1 coins on the other pan form two groups containing a total 
of 2x + 1 ^ 3 n_l coins, to which we can apply the result of problem 
A just investigated. Therefore, n — 1 further weight trials at most, 
suffice here also. This completes the proof that, under the conditions

Moreover, we now have on hand 2x coins known to be genuine, and 
in view of the result obtained in case (B) we are able to find the 
counterfeit by n — 1 additional weight trials. If one of the pans 
outweighs the other, then we can apply the result of case A to the 
coins on the scale, since the total number of coins on the two pans 
is 2x < 3 n_1 , and n — 1 additional weight trials suffice to locate the 
counterfeit. 

We shall now prove that if 


then n weight trials will not , in genera /, suffice . For the first weight

7. (a) If the third link is disengaged from the chain, then there 
are three pieces: the single link, a two-link piece, and a four-link 
piece. On the first day the traveler gives the single link to the inn¬ 
keeper. On the second day he gives the innkeeper the two-link piece, 
receiving the single link back in change. On the third day the tra¬ 
veler pays the single link; on the fourth day he presents the four-

link piece, receiving as change the single link and the two-link piece. 
On the fifth day he gives the single link, and on the sixth day the 
single link is returned to him as change for the two link piece. 
Finally, the single link pays for the seventh day's lodging. Hence, 
only one link need be disengaged from the chain. 

(b) It will be convenient to consider first the following problem. 
If k links are disengaged from an w-Iink chain, where k is a fixed 
number, how large can n be such that any number of links from 1 
to n can be obtained by taking one or more of the severed pieces 
of the chain? To solve this problem, we first investigate which links 
would be most advantageous to remove. After removing k single 
links we can gather from these any number of links from 1 to k. 
But if we want k + 1 links, we must consider the remaining pieces 
of chain and in particular those pieces having k + 1 or fewer links. 

Clearly, the most convenient arrangement would be to have a piece 
of chain with exactly k + 1 links. Then we could gather any number 
of links from 1 to 2k + 1. In order to collect 2k + 2 = 2 (k + 1) links, 
we need another piece containing 2(k + 1), or fewer, links. The most 
convenient situation would be to have a piece with exactly 2(6+1) links; 
we could then gather any number of links from 1 to (26 + 1) +2(6 + 1) = 
46 + 3. The next step would be to have available a piece of chain 
with 46 + 4 = 4(6 + 1) links. Continuing this reasoning, the most ad¬ 
vantageous method of removing links from the chain would be to 
have pieces of the following lengths (setting aside the individual 
severed links): 


6 + 1, 2(6 + 1), 4(6 + 1), 8(6 + 1), ■ ■ •, 2*(6 + 1) . 
Thus, any number of links from 1 to 


n = k + [(6 + 1) + 2(6 + 1 ) + 4(6 + 1 ) + ■ • • + 2*(6 + 1 )] 

= 6 + ( 2 k+l - 1)(6 + 1 ) - 2* +1 (6 + 1 ) - 1 

can be built up by taking pieces of the chain. 

Thus, if 2*6 ^ n ^ 2* +1 (6 + 1) — 1, then it is possible to make 6 
breaks in the chain, but removal of 6 — 1 links will not suffice to 
solve the problem. In particular, if 


2 ^ n ^ 7, then 

8 ^ n ^ 23, then 
24 ^ n ^ 63, then 
64 ^ n ^ 159, then 


k = 1; 

160 g n £ 

k = 2- 

384 g n ^ 

k = 3\ 

896 g n ^ 




383, then 6 = 5; 
895, then 6 = 6; 
2047, then 6 = 7. 


Therefore, if n = 2000, the least number of links which can be dis¬ 
engaged is 7. The conditions of the problem will be satisfied if we 
select those links such that the 8 pieces of chain we obtain (excluding 
the 7 individual severed links) have, respectively, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 
256, 512, and 977 links. 

8. Let A be the first of the selected students (that is, the tallest 
of the short), and let B be the second of the selected students (the 
shortest of the tall). If A and B stand in the same row, then B is 
taller than A , since B is the tallest student in that row. If A and 
B stand in the same column, then again B is taller than A, since A 
is the shortest student in that column. Finally, if A and B do not 
stand in either the same column or the same row, let C be that student 
standing in the same column as does A and in the same row as does 
B. Then B is taller than C (since B is the tallest in that row), and 
C is taller than A (since A is the shortest in that column). Hence, 
again B is taller than A; and so in every possible case B is taller 
than A . 

9. First, it follows from the conditions of the problem that each 
gear weighs either an even number of grams or an odd number of 
grams. The reasoning is as follows. Since any set of twelve gears 
can be divided into two groups of equal weight, a set of twelve gears 
will weigh an even number of grams. This total weight remains an 
even number if one of the twelve gears is exchanged with the thir¬ 
teenth gear. But this is possible only if the exchanged gear and the 
thirteenth gear are both of even weight or both of odd weight, and 
this holds for any of the twelve gears initially weighed. Hence, all 
the gears are of even, or all are of odd, weight. 

Subtract now from the weight of each gear the weight of the 
lightest gear (possibly two or more gears have the same minimum 
weight; this is unimportant). This may be thought of as producing 
a “new” set of gears, and this new set clearly again satisfies the 
conditions of the problem. (One of the gears, and possibly more, must 
now be thought of as having “zero weight”.) It is easily seen that 
each gear of the new set has even weight (counting 0 as an even 
number), since if all the gears were of odd weight initially, then an 
odd number was subtracted from each individual weight; if they 
were all of even weight initially, then an even number was sub¬ 
tracted from each individual weight. 

If now we divide each weight by 2 and think of this as providing 
a “new” set of weights, this new set again satisfies the conditions 




96 


Introductory Problems 


of the problem. 

Assume now that not all the gears are of the same weight. In 
this case, not all the weights of the second set (obtained by subtract¬ 
ing the weights of the lightest gear from each of the original weights) 
will be zero. If we continue to divide by 2, thus obtaining “new” 
sets satisfying the conditions of the problem, we finally arrive at a 
set of gears of which some are of even weight (at least one is of zero 
weight) and some are of odd weight (continued division of an even 
natural number by 2 finally produces an odd number). But such a 
set satisfying the conditions of the problem has been shown to be 
impossible. This contradiction proves the assertion of the problem. 

Remark : The conditions of the problem require that all the gears be of in¬ 
tegral weight, but the result can be extended to weights which are rational 
numbers. If we multiply each of the weights by the least common multiple of 
all the denominators, we obtain a “new” set of weights, all integers, and all 
of which still satisfy the conditions of the problem, and we go on from there. 
Moreover, if we allow the weights to be irrational numbers, the extension can 
again be made, since irrational numbers can be approximated by rational num¬ 
bers to as close a tolerance as desired. (The reader is invited to carry out 
such a proof, although a rigorous demonstration is by no means a simple task.) 

10. Beginning with the third row of the number triangle we write 
the first four numbers of each row, but putting in place of an even 
number the letter e y and in place of an odd number the letter 0: 

0 e 0 0 

0 0 e 0 
0 e e e 

0 0 0 e 

0 e 0 e 


Note that the fifth row of the array coincides with the first row. 
But the evenness or oddness of the first four numbers of every row 
of the number triangle depends only upon the evenness or oddness 
of the first four numbers of the preceding row. Hence, in the above 
array any row will periodically duplicate itself in the fourth row 
following. Since an even number occurs in each of the first four 
rows shown above, an even number must occur in every subsequent 


row.

11 The plan is to number the squares consecutively from 1 to 12, 
starting, say, from the red chip, and continuing on through the chips 
and around the circle, and then to rearrange the ^aresbyput i g 
them in an order in which it is possible to move a chip from o 
square to the next. That is, after square 1 we place square 6 (since 
by the conditions of the problem it is possible for a chip to move 
from square 1 to square 6, and vice-versa), t en a ter d 

place square 11 (since a chip may move from square 6 to 11), and 
afS square 11 we place square 4, and so on. After this rearrange¬

The chips (red, yellow, green, blue, designated R, Y,G,B)are

G on 3, and B on 4. The rule by which the chips may now move 
is simple: A chip may move one square in either direction, P r ° v ^ 
that square is unoccupied. Clearly, the only way in which a ch p 
can change places with another is for it to move around the rectangle 
in either direction, but now a chip can neither jump over nor occupy 
the position of another chip. Thus, if chip R moves to occupy square 
4 then B must occupy square 2, Y must occupy square 3, and G must 
move to square 1. If R occupies square 2 then B must ^upy square 
3, Y must move to square 1, and G will occupy square . 
cupies square 3, then B occupies square 1, Y moves to 4 an 
moves to square 2. Other than these three rearrangements, no a 
rangement differing from the initial one is possilbe.

Second solution The problem can be solved more readily and with

dividing N by 125. All the conditions together determine the re¬ 
mainder obtained by dividing N by 5 6 = 15,625. These numbers ap¬ 
pear at intervals of 15,625 in the sequence of natural numbers. r 

We can now calculate the remainder which N yields upon division 
by 5®, but this is not necessary. One number satisfying all the im¬ 
posed conditions is —4, which upon division by 5 yields a quotient 
of —1 and a remainder of +1. If we subtract the number 1 from 
—4 and divide the difference by 4/5, then divide the result by 5, we 
again obtain a remainder of +1. Accordingly, upon all further di¬ 
visions by 5 we will obtain the same remainder of +1. The num¬ 
ber —4 cannot, of course, be the answer to the problem, since N has 
to be a positive integer. But since we do know one number which 
satisfies the conditions of the problem, we can find as many others 
as we wish by adding multiples of 5 6 . The least positive number 
which we can add to satisfy the given conditions is 5 6 itself; we ob¬ 
tain -4 + 5 6 = 15625 - 4 = 15,621. 

13. Let n be the number of sheep in the herd. Then the brothers 
received n rubles for each sheep, and so they received a total of 
N= n^n — n 2 rubles. Let d represent the digit in the tens place of 
the number n y and let e be the digit in the units place; then n = 
\M + e , and 

N = (lOd + e) z = 100 d 2 + 20 de + e z . 

It follows, from the manner in which the money was divided, and 
since the older brother had one more selection from the money than 
did his brother, that there must have been an odd number of tens 
in N> plus a remaining number less than 10. But 100^/ 2 + 20 de = 
20d(5d -f e) is divisible by 20 and so contains an even number of tens. 
Consequently, the number e z must contain an odd number of tens. 
Since e < 10 (being the remainder obtained by dividing n by 10), the 
only possible values for e are 1,4,9, 16,25,36,49,64, or 81. 

Of these numbers, only 16 and 36 contain an odd number of tens, 
so the possibilities for e z are limited to 16 or 36. Both of these 
numbers end with the digit 6, which means that the remainder the 
younger brother received in place of 10 rubles was 6 rubles. Thus, 
the older brother received 4 rubles more than did the younger. To 
make the division even, the older brother would have to give the

year has 365 days except for leap-years (those years whose identify- 

* ng n i l ™ ber 1S dlvls ‘ble by 4—for example, I960). The leap-vears 
have 366 days (the extra day being February 29). However, there is 
an exception to this rule: any year whose identifying number is dl 
vlsi e y 100 but not by 400 has only 365 days instead of 366; that 
is, ose are not leap years. For example, the years 1800 and 1900 

?nno e rh h P ye K T S: a ' S0> 2100 Wil1 not be a lea P year. However, 
2000 (being divisible by 400) will be a leap year. The problem asks 

on which of the two days, Saturday or Sunday, New Years Day 
more frequently falls. y 

We shall show that any 400-year period of time presents a periodic 
pattern, in the sense that the next 400-year period will exactly du- 

thi^mnnlh* < | f S ° f the previous 400-year period (for example, 
this month s calender is exactly the same as that of exactly 400 years 

agoX This interval of 400 years contains an integral number of 
weeks. Leap years have 52 weeks and 2 days, and other years have 
52 weeks and 1 day. In the course of four years, of which one is 
a leap year, there are 4-52 weeks plus 5 days. In the course of 400 
years there would be an additional 500 days, but because three of 
these years are divisible by 100 but not by 400 (and so are not leap 
years) the 400 years will have only 497 days in addition to 400.52 
weeks, that is, there are an additional 71 weeks. Therefore, the 
problem can be limited to any 400-year period. 

Let us investigate the 400-year period from 1901 to 2301 Everv 
fourth year is a leap year (since there is no exception for leap years 
in this interval). In span of 28 years there will be one “extra’^ week 
owing to leap years; in addition, there will be an additional 28 days’ 
or 4 weeks, over an exact number of weeks. Thus, a 28-year inter¬ 
val yields an integral number of weeks: 28-52 + 5 weeks 
We select a particular New Year's Day: January 1, 1952, which 
fell on a Tuesday. Since 1952 was a leap year, and a leap year has 
2 days over 52 weeks, January 1, 1953, fell on a Thursday but ia-

’ 1955, fell on a Saturday, and so on. January 1, 1951, fell on a 
Monday, January, 1, 1950, fell on a Sunday, and so on In the 28 
year period 1929 1956, inclusive, January 1 fell exactly four times on 
each day of the week. This distribution was exactly the same for

the 28-year period 1901-1928, inclusive. We recall that a 28-year period 
in which every fourth year is a leap year contains an integral num¬ 
ber of weeks, and, consequently, we repeat the same distribution of 
New Year’s Days over the days of the week as obtained for the pre¬ 
vious 28-year period. The interval 1901-2096 (inclusive) contains 196 
years, a number divisible by 28 (the year 2000 not providing any 
exception for leap year). In this interval, New Year’s Day will have 
fallen exactly the same number of times on each day of the week. 

Further, January 1, 2097, will fall on the same day of the week as 
did january 1, 1901, January 1, 1929, and so on—it will fall on a Tues¬ 
day. Thus, New Year’s Day of 2100 will fall on a Friday, and New 
Year’s Day of 2101 will fall on a Saturday (2100 is not a leap year). 
The 28-year period 2101-2128 will differ from the 28-year period 1901— 
1928 in that the period begins not on a Tuesday but on a Saturday. 
This calls for a corresponding shift in the days on which New Year’s 
Day will fall. However, in the period 1901-1928 New Year’s Day 
fell exactly four times on each day of the week, and this will hap¬ 
pen also in the period 2101-2128. The 28-year intervals 2129-2156 
and 2157-2184 will follow the same pattern. The year 2185 begins 
on the same day as did 2101—Saturday; this allows us to find the data 
for the period 2185 to 2201. Simple calculation shows that in the 
interval from 2185 to 2200 New Year’s Day will fall twice each on 
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, but three times 
each on Sunday and Tuesday. New Year’s Day of 2201 will fall on 
a Thursday. In the course of the 3*28 = 84 years, from 2201 to 2284, 
New Year’s Day will fall the same number of times on each day of 
the week. New Year's Day 2285 will fall on the same day it will 
in 2201—Thursday. This allows us to determine the data for the 
period 2285-2300. In this interval January 1 will fall twice each on 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and three 
times each on Sunday and Friday. Similarly, over these periods in 
the course of which New Year’s Day will fall the same number of 
times on each day we counted 2 + 2 = 4 Mondays, 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 
Tuesdays, 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 Wednesdays, 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 Thursdays, 6 
Fridays, 4 Saturdays, and 6 Sundays. It follows that New Year’s 
Day falls more often on Sunday than on Saturday, 

(b) Employing methods analogous to those used in problem (a), 
we can show that in the 400-year interval the thirtieth day of the 
month will fall on Sunday 687 times, on Monday 685 times, on Tues¬ 
day 685 times, on Wednesday 687 times, on Thursday 684 times, on

Friday 688 times, and on Saturday 684 times. Thus, the thirtieth 
day of the month falls most often on a Friday. 

15. It is clear that if the final digit of an integer is deleted, the 
integer is reduced by a factor of at least 10. If that final digit is 
zero then, of course, the number is reduced by exactly the factor 

10, and so all such numbers automatically satisfy the conditions of 
the problem. 

Assume now that if the final digit of a number * is deleted then 
the digit is reduced by an integral factor exceeding 10, say, by the 
factor 10 + a {a ^ 1). Let y be the quotient obtained by dividing a: 
by 10, and let 2 be the remainder; that is, x = lOy + z(z ^ 9). If the 
last digit of x is deleted, then the deleted digit is 2 , and the new 

number is equal to y. The condition of the problem then calls for 
the equation 

x = (10 + a)*y , 

or the equation 

lOy + 2 = (10 + a)-y , 

from which we obtain 

z — ay . 

Since 2 < 10, both a and y must be less than 10. Therefore except 
for the numbers divisible by 10, the only integers meeting the con¬ 
ditions of the problem are two-digit numbers; also, if the final digit 

1S r d , e !nf’ ° riginaI integer can be reduced b y> at most, a factor 
of 19(11 = 10 + a < 19). It is easily shown that only the following 

two-digit numbers are reduced by a factor of 11 when their last digit 
is deleted: 11, 22, 33,44,55,66, 77,88, 99. (If 10 + a = 11, then a = 1- 
hence z - ay = y, and x = 10_y + z = lly, where y — 1, 2, 3, ■ • 9.) It 

can be shown, in an analogous way, that the only two-digit integers 
reduced by a factor of 12 upon deletion of the final digit are 12 24 
36, 48 (z = ay = 2y, where onlyy = 1, 2, 3, 4 are possible, since z<lo’ 
and 12_y). The numbers diminished by a factor of 13 are 13,26! 
39, the numbers diminished by a factor of 14 are 14 and 28. It is 

-t n " hat the only numbers which can be reduced by factors of 
15, 16, 17, 18, 19 are these numbers themselves. 

16. (a) Let the integer sought have k + 1 digits. It may be writ- 
ten in the form 6-10* +y, where y is a *-digit number (it may pos¬ 
sibly begin with one or more zeros). The conditions of the problem 
are expressed by 


Solutions (15-17) 


103 


6-10* + y = 25y , 
or 


Clearly, it is necessary that k ^ 2, since 60 is not divisible exactly 
by 24 and y is an integer. For k 2 the integer y is equal to 
25-10* -2 ; that is, y has the form 250* • *0, where there are k — 2 zeros. 
Therefore, all the numbers sought are of the form 6250---0, where 
there are n zeros and n = 0,1, 2, 3, 

(b) Solve this problem: Find a number whose first digit is a and 
which is reduced by a factor of 35 when its final digit is deleted 
Proceeding as in problem (a), we have the equation 



where y is an integer [see solution of problem (a)]. But the right 
member of this equation cannot possibly be an integer a ^ 9 and 
k ^ 1 . 


Remark : Proceeding as we did in problems 16 (a) and (b), we can show that 
an integer beginning with a given digit a can be reduced by an integral fac¬ 
tor b upon deletion of the digit a only if a <b — 1 and the (proper) fraction 

a - can be represented as a finite decimal fraction (that is, all the prime 
0 — 1 

factors of 6 — 1 other than 2 and 5 are factors of a, of sufficient multiplicity). 
For example, no integer can be reduced by a factor of 85 by deleting its first 
digit, since 85 — 1 = 84 includes 3 and 7 among its factors and no digit is 
divisible by both 3 and 7. Again, any number which is reduced by a factor 
of 15 upon deletion of its first digit must commence with 7, since 14 has 7 as 
a factor. A general criterion which will give the necessary form of an integer 
having a known first digit a and which is reduced by a factor b upon deletion 
of the first digit is usually easy to find. 


17. (a) First we show that no integer can be diminished to $ its 
original value by deleting a digit standing farther from its beginning 
than the second place. Let the digits of the number N be a 0t a u a 2y * * ■, 
a n (a Q =f= 0); that is, 

a Q ■ 10 n + a i • 10 n_1 + ••• +a n = N .

Assume that — is an integer, and that it has been obtained by de¬ 
leting a digit past the second position. We have

This equation states that to divide — by 9, we merely delete the 

first digit a 0 . This solves problem (a).

This is the form that N must have. It is evident that a Q cannot be 
either of the digits 8 or 9, inasmuch as the second digit of N is re¬ 
quired to be zero. If we try successively a 0 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, along 
with the least necessary value of n which will make N an integer, 
we have the following seven numbers, which satisfy the conditions 
of the problem: 

10,125; 2025; 30,375; 405; 50,625; 6075; 70,875 . 

These numbers, together with all products by 10* (k — 1, 2, 3, ■ • ■) con¬ 
stitute all the integers which satisfy the conditions of the problem. 

18. (a) The proposition is equivalent to the assertion that the in¬ 
teger is diminished by some factor m when the third digit is delet¬ 
ed. Let 

TV = flo*10 B + tfrlO* -1 + tf 2 -10 n_2 + • • • +a n . 

Then 

10 — = a 0 TO n + a.-lO”- 1 + flg-lO"-’ + • •• + a.-10 .

If m < 10, then subtraction of the first equation from the second 

yields the inequality —- —N< 10 B_1 , which is impossible, since

and

Again, if m — 11, then we must 


If m> 11, then m m ~-N< which also is impossibile for an 

analogous reason (f~~> ~). Again, if m = 11, then we must 

have — TV < that is, ~= ^ has two digits fewer than TV, which 

is an impossibility. 

P0S5i ^ Vlty :° f obtainin S a number satisfying the condi¬ 
tions of the problem is to let m = 10. Therefore, the conditions 
require numbers all of whose digits, except the first two, are zero 

Such integers satisfy the requirement and hence describe the num¬ 
bers sought. 

Remark: It is possible to show, by similar reasoning, that the only integers 
which are diminished by an integral factor when the Ath digit, where k > 3 
is deleted are those having zeros after the first k - 1 digits. 

(b) The requirement that a number TV be diminished by an in¬ 
tegral factor m when its second digit is deleted is expressed as follows: 

N ~ £ 0 * 10* + a v • 10” -1 + a z - 10*^ 2 + * * • + a n , 

— = a o -10*-' + + a% . 


It follows that 


- N — a Q -10 n — a r 10 n - ] + Aq-IO”- 1 , 


or, upon solving for N, 


_ (9g 0 + g?)-10* l 'tn 
m — 1 


These equations can be combined to yield 
N = a 0 ■ 10" + a, ■ 10 n_1 - a„ ■ 10"“* + 


(9a, + a,)-10"~ 
m — 1 


But, on the other hand, we know that TV is an (« + l)-digit number 
beginning with digits a 0 and a,: 

N = tfo-10" + a.-lO- 1 + as-lO- 2 + ... + Un t 


where we may assume that not all the digits a 2 , are zero 

(otherwise the problem leads to investigation of two-digit numbers 

Af; see the solution to problem 15). The following inequality must 
nold:

or, equivalently, 


„ ^ 9<z 0 + ch ^ 

a 0 <-— < a 0 + 1 . 

m — 1 


As a consequence, we have the following results. The required 
numbers N are expressed by (1), where 0 ^ a Q ^ 9, 0 ^ ai ^ 9. Since 
N is an integer, and m and m — 1 are relatively prime, the proper 

fraction ^ a ° can be written as a terminating decimal. When 

m — 1 

this is done the possible values of a Qf a x and m must satisfy inequa¬ 
lities (2) in addition, it is necessary to add to the possible values of 
N the two-digit numbers obtained in the solution of problem 15). 
There now remains only successive investigations of the possible 
values for a 0 . 

(1) a 0 = 1. Here, inequality (2) yields 

1 < —, m — 1 < 18 ; 
m — 1 

—< 2, m - 1 > 4 . 
m — 1 

Applying the m — 1 successive values 5,6,7, ■ • •, 17, and selecting, 
each time the appropriate value of a 1( we obtain 

TV = 108; 105; 10,125; 1125; 12,375; 135; 14,625;

There is no N for a a = 9. 

In toto, including the results of problem 15, there are 104 values 

for N. An arbitrary number of zeros can be adjoined to each of 
these. 

19. (a) First solution. Let X be the m-digit number obtained by 
deleting the first digit 1 from the integer sought. That integer is 
then 10" + X, and the new number is \0X + 1. The condition of 
the problem yields 

(10" + AT) -3 = 10A + 1 , 
or 

v _ 3-10" - 1 
-7-■ 

The last equation provides a condition for finding X: 3-10" = 3000- • ■ 
must yield the remainder 1 upon division by 7. Direct division by 
7 shows that the least number of zeros necessary after 3 to produce 
a remainder of 1 is 5; that is, 3-10 s = 300,000 = 7(42,857) + 1. Thus, 
the least possible value for the integer X is 42,857, and hence the 
number sought is 142,857. 

To find other such numbers, we note that in dividing 3000- ■ - by 7 
we need not stop at the first remainder 1; any quotient obtained for 
the remainder 1 will serve as an X. It is readily seen that the other 
numbers will be 


142,857,142,857; • ■ •; 142,857,142, 857- • ■ 142,857; 


k times 


Second solution. Let * be the second digit of the number sought, 
let y be the third and so on; that is, the number has the form 

1 xy-'-zt (the over bar denotes a succession of digits rather than a 
product). The condition of the problem states 


Solutions (19-20) 


109 


Ixy* ■ *zt -3 = xy'"Zt\ . 

It is at once apparent that t = 7 (in no other case will the product 
on the left yield a final digit 1). Therefore, the tens digit t on the 
right is 7. But this is possible only if 2*3 ends in 7 — 2 = 5 (3*2 plus 
a carry-over of 2 must yield 7); that is, 2 = 5. There is a carry-over 
of 1. The product, 3 times the hundreds digit on the left, plus the 
1 carried over, must yield 5; and so on. The reader can readily make 
up an organized format for this process. For example, 

1 4 2 8 57 42857 

x 3 ..1 

4-1 = 3, 2-0 = 2, 8-2 = 6, 5-1 = 4, 7-2 = 5 
(the calculations are made from right to left). The smallest possible 
number occurs when we reach the digit 1 on the left, 142,857. 

If this process is continued, we obtain other numbers satisfying 
the conditions by stopping whenever we have adjoined another 1 on 
the left: 

142,857,142,857-•• 142,857; ■■■ . 

----- 

k times 

(b) When an integer is tripled, the resulting integer can have 
the same number of digits only if the initial digit of the first num¬ 
ber did not exceed 3. As we saw in problem (a), the first digit can 
be 1. We shall show now that it cannot be 3. 

If the first digit of the integer sought is 3, we see from the re¬ 
quired equality 3ry---2-3 = xy---z3 that its second digit (that is, x) 
must be 9. But 3 times any integer beginning with 39 yields an in¬ 
teger having one more digit. Hence the first digit of any integer 
meeting the conditions of the problem cannot be 3. 

It is left to the reader to show that the numbers sought may be¬ 
gin with the digit 2. The smallest such number is 285,714; all such 
numbers are of form 


285,714,285,714-■-285,714 . 


k times 

The proof is quite similar to that of problem (a). 


20. Since after multiplication by 5 the number of digits remains 
the same, the initial integer must begin with the digit 1. This di¬ 
git then becomes the final digit of the new number, which is not 
divisible by 5.

The solutions for the digits 6 and 8 are similar. 

J 1 - ^rst solution Since the number of digits is not increased 
ter muitiplicat 101 ! by 2, the first digit of the initial number cannot 
exceed 4. Since after the transfer of the first digit to the end we 
have an even number (twice the original number), the first digit must 
be even; hence it must be either 2 or 4. 

Consider now the number X obtained by deleting the first digit of 

e original number sought. Reasoning as we did for problem 19 
(a), we obtain 

(2-10* + X)-2 = 10-X+2 , 

that is, 

v_ 4-10* - 2 2-10™ - 1 

8 4 ’ 

or else 

(4-10* + X)-2 = 10A + 4 , 


that is, 




However, both of these formulas are impossible, since they do not 
yield integers (the numerator is odd for both). 

Second solution. As in the first solution we conclude that the first 
digit of the number sought must be either 2 or 4. We use the nota¬ 
tion employed in problem 19 (a). We have 

2 -ry- ■ -zt-2 = xy- • - 2/2 

or else 


4xy---zt-2 = xy - ■ -zt\ . 


In the first case, t can be only 1 or 6 (otherwise the product on 
the left cannot end with the digit 2). But if / = 1, then on the left 
is a number not divisible by 4, and on the right is a number divisible 
by 4 (an integer being divisible by 4 if and only if the number com¬ 
posed of its last two digits is divisible by 4). If / = 6, then on the 
left is a number divisible by 4 (product of two even numbers), but 
on the right is a number not divisible by 4 (ending in 62). 

In the second case, t can be only 2 or 7. If t = 2, then [as in the 
second solution of problem 19(a)], necessarily, z = 1 , and it follows 
that the product on the left is divisible by 8 (product of a number

divisible by 4, since it ends in 12, and 2), but the number on the 
right is not divisible by 8 (ending in 124). 

The demonstration for / = 7 is left to the reader. It is quite simi¬ 
lar to the foregoing solutions. 

22. (a) First solution. A number increased seven-fold upon trans¬ 
fer of its first digit to the end must commence with the digit 1 
(otherwise the larger number would contain more digits than the 
original). As was done in problem 19 (a), we let X be the m-digit 
integer obtained by deleting the first digit, 1, of the number sought. 
Then, as in the previous problems, 

(mo™ + xyi = 10 .*+ i , 

which yields 

7*10* - 1 
X ~ 3 ‘ 

But it is obvious that there is no m for which * can be an m- digit 
number (- ^ ~ - 1 > 10*). 

A similar demostration will prove that there is no number which 
is increased nine-fold by transfer of its initial digit to the end of the 
number. 

Second solution . We conclude, as in the first solution, that the 
number sought must begin with the digit 1. Using the terminology 
explained in problem 19 (b), we have the following statement of our 
problem: 

1 xy- * 'zt’7 = xy- • -z/1 . 

It follows that the product /■ 7 must end with the digit 1, which re¬ 
quires that t = 3. Insertion of this digit for t yields 1y- * • z3-7—y ■ • *z31. 
Since 3-7 = 21, and the product of of z3 by 7 ends in the succession 
of digits 31, this product has 1 as a final digit. Consequently, z is 
also equal to 3. A similar procedure shows that each successive 
digit (from this end forward) is equal to 3. However, the initial 
digit of the number must be 1, which is impossible. 

Therefore, there does not exist any integer which increases seven¬ 
fold upon transfer of its first digit to the end. 

(b) First solution . Inasmuch as the number to be obtained upon 
multiplying the sought integer by 4 must not contain a greater num¬ 
ber of digits than before, the initial digit cannot exceed 2. Since 
transfer of the initial digit to the end must produce an even num-

ber sought must be 2. Moreover,

and moving from right to left, we find that the tens position of the 
number must have the digit 3. But the initial number must com¬ 
mence with the digit 2. This is obviously impossible.

It is clear that t = 1; we can determine the digit z (17*3 yields 51; 
this means that z — 5), and, moving from right to left we obtain, 
successively, the digits forming the integer sought. The process 
ends when we obtain the digit 7. It is convenient to display the 
result in the following form: 

241379310344827586206896551 7241379310344827586206896551 

.7*3 .. 

(the calculations are made from right to left). Thus, the least integer 
satisfying the conditions of the problem is 7,241,379,310,344,827,586, 
206,896,551. 

If in the course of these calculations we do not stop when we first 
obtain a 7, we can find additional numbers which satisfy the condi¬ 
tions of the problem. All such numbers will be of the form 


7241379310344827586206896551 • • • 7241379310344827586206896551

Second solution . Let 7 xyz • • ■ t be the integer sought. Division by 
3 must yield the integer xyz * * • t7. We write this requirement in 
the form 

7xyz ■ * * t |_3_ 

xyz - • • t7 . 

It is clear that x = 2 is necessary. If we replace x by 2 in the 
dividend and quotient, we can find the next digit of the quotient, 
and this is also the third digit of the dividend; we can then deter¬ 
mine the third digit of the quotient, which is the fourth digit of the 
dividend, and so on. The process is complete when the final digit 
of the quotient is 7 and simultaneously the dividend is exactly divi¬ 
sible by 3. This dividend is then the number sought and is the 
least integer having the required property. 

The following arrangement is a convenient scheme for carrying 
out this computation (the numbers in the second row are written last):

The same procedure will solve the following problem: 

Find the least integer commencing with a given digit a which is decreased 
by a factor l when the first digit is transferred to the end. 

24 (a) The conditions of the problem may be expressed by the 
equality y 1C 

xy zt • a = tz ■ ■ • yx , 

where a is one of the numbers 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8. 

If a = 5, then * must be 1; otherwise the number on the right 
wil contain one digit too many. (The case in which * is 0 may be 
excluded, since upon multiplying each side by 2 and deleting the 



Solutions (24) 


115 


final zero we obtain y • ■ * zt — 2'tz ■ • * y\ that is, we arrive at the 
same problem as for a = 2.) But the integer tz • • * yl is not divisi¬ 
ble by 5. Analogous reasoning will prove that a cannot be 6 or 8. 

If a — 7, then x again must be 1. In this case, t must be the 
digit 3, otherwise \y • ■ ■ z/-7 fails to end with the digit 1. But the 
equation ly • • • z3-7 = 3z • ■ ■ yl is clearly impossible, since the left 
number is greater than the right number. 

If a = 2, then x cannot exceed 4. Since the integer tz " - yx must 
be even, x is either 2 or 4. If x = 4, the digit t (the first digit of 
4y • ■ ■ zt' 2) can be only 8 or 9, and neither 4y ■ • * z8*2 nor 4y * * ■ z9*2 
ends with the digit 4. If x — 2, then t (the first digit of 2y • * ■ zt*2) 
can only be 4 or 5; but neither 2y ■ • * z4*2 nor 2y * • ■ z5*2 can end 
in 2. 

Finally, if z = 3, then x cannot exceed 3. If x = 1, then t must 
be 7 (f*3 ends in 1); if x = 2, then / must be 4; if x = 3, then / must 
be 1. But in the first case, tz • • • yx is certainly greater than jty- * *z/*3, 
and in the second and their cases it is clearly smaller. 

(b) Let xy • • • zt be an integer which is i its inversion. We then 

have 

xy * • - zt • 4 = tz • • • yx . 

Since xy z/*4 is to contain the same number of digits as does 
xy ■ * ■ zt, the digit x can be only 0, 1, or 2. Since tz ■ * * yx must be 
divisible by 4, it follows that x must be even, and so the only pos¬ 
sibilities are x = 0 (if we allow 0 to be counted as a digit at the be¬ 
ginning of the integer), or x = 2. 

Suppose x — 0. Then / = 0 or else / = 5. Write oy • • • yt-4 = 
tz ■ • • yO; we note that t cannot be the digit 5 (regardless what digit 
y is), and so the only possibility is t=0. We can now write y- • -z-4 = 
z • * • y; that is, if a number meeting the condition of the problem 
begins with 0, then it also ends in 0, and the integer obtained by 
deleting these two zeros will also meet the conditions of the problem. 

It suffices therefore to investigate x = 2, for which 2y • ■ ■ zt • 4 = 
tz ■ ■ * y2. Since 2*4 = 8, / can be only 8 or 9, but t = 9 can imme¬ 
diately be eliminated as a possibility. Thus, / = 8, and we can write 
2y • ■ * z8-4 = 8z- • -y2. Since 23-4 > 90^y can be only 0, 1, or 2; also, 
the tens digit of any product of form z8*4 must be odd. Thus, y = l. 
Since we know the final two digits (12) in the product 21 * * • z8 ■ 4, 
we can easily find the only two possibilities for the next successive 
digit: z can be only 2 or 7. But 21-4 > 82, which means that z = 7. 



116 


Alterations of Digits in Integers 


Hence, the number must have the form 21 * * ■ 78. We note that 
the integer 2178 satisfies the condition of the problem, and hence it 
is the only such four-digit number. We now consider solutions in 
terms of integers having more than four digits. We must have 

21 uv ■ • • rs78*4 = 87 sr • ■ ■ vu\2 , 
which may be written 

84'10* +2 + 312 + uv--- rs00■ 4 

= 87-10 fc+2 + 12 + sr • • * vuOO , 
or 

uv • - - rs- 4 -b 3 = 3 sr • • * vu. 

Since when the number uv ■ * • rs is multiplied by 4, and 3 is added, 
the digit 3 is produced as the leading digit of the resulting calcula¬ 
tion, the digit u must be at least as great as 6, but since 3 sr ■ • ■ vu 
must be odd, the only possibilities are 9 or 7. We shall investigate 
both possibilities. 

When u — 9 we have 

9v • ■ * rs • 4 + 3 = 3sr • • • v9 , 

from which it follows that s = 9(5-4 must terminate in 6; if 5 = 4, 
then 34r - * • v9 is smaller than yy • * - r4-4 + 3), and so 

9v • • • r9 • 4 + 3 = 39r • • • v9 . 

That is (for u = 9), in order for 21 uv - • • rs78 to meet the conditions 
of the problem, the final digit of uv - • • rs must also be 9. In par¬ 
ticular, uv • ■ • rs must be 9, 99, 999, and so on. We obtain the num¬ 
bers 

21,978; 219,978; 2199; 978; 

We can easily verify that all such numbers satisfy the conditions of 
the problem. 

When u = 7 we have 

7v • • • r5-4 + 3 — 35r ■ • • v7 . 

Reasoning as we did initially in this problem, we find that 5 = 1, 
v = 8, r = 2; that is, the digit sequence uv - " rs must have the form 
78 - - * 21. We can easily verify that if the digit pairs 78 and 21 are 
inserted between 21 as the first digit pair, and 78 as the last digit 
pair, the resulting integer satisfies the conditions of the problem: 
For example,

21 78 21 78 21 78-4 = 87 12 87 12 87 12 . 

But according to the treatment for a = 9we will also obtain solu¬ 
tions if we insert the digit 9 in the appropriate positions. For ex¬ 
ample, the following numbers are solutions: 

0; 2178; 21,978; 219,978; 

2199 • • • 978, 2199 • • • 9978, • • • . (J ) 

k times (k + 1) times 

The insertion of the digit 9 may be made after any sequence 21, 
provided it is also made in the equivalent location counted from the 
other end of the number. Thus, any sequential array of digits of 
the form 

PiP t • ■ • Pn-lPnPn-l ■ ■ ■ PtPl , 

where each letter Pi is one of the numbers from the display (1). For 
example

02,199,999,780 . 

(The last number can be considered a solution if we allow zeros at 
the beginning of the number.) 

It may be proven in an analogous way that all integers which are 
increased by a factor of 9 upon reversal of the digits can be obtained 
by sequentially placing together integers of the form 

0; 1089; 10,989; 109,989; • ■ 1099_— 989; 1099_— 9989; ■ • •

In this display, not only must each row contain (on the right) all 
six distinct digits 1,2,4, 5, 7, and 8, but each column must contain 
these six distinct digits, in some order. Suppose that £-2 and £-5 
have the same digit a in a certain position, say in the third position 
(a can have only one of the two values not assumed by either the 
first or the last digit of either of the two investigated numbers). 
Since the difference £-5 — £-2 = £*3 will be a six-digit number, 
either the digit 0 or the digit 9 will stand in its third position (since 
we can take, at most, a unit carry-over into this place for the sub¬ 
traction). But this is an impossibility, since we already know that 
the number £-3 will contain neither an 0 nor a 9 as one of its digits. 

Therefore, in the above display of £-l,£-2, the sum of the di¬ 
gits in any column is 14-2 + 44-5 + 74-8 = 27. We can therefore 
add the right member of this display and obtain 

£•21 = 2,999,997 , 

whence x = 142,857, which is the integer sought. As a check we 
have:

27. (a) By factorization, — n = (n — 1 )n(n + 1). The factors on 
the right represent three consecutive integers, whence one of them 
is divisible by 3. 

(b) n b — n = n(n — l)(w + l)(/z 2 +l). If the integer n terminates 
with one of the digits 0,1,4, 5,6, or 9, then one of the first three 
factors on the right is divisible by 5. If n ends in one of the digits 
2, 3, 7 or 8, then n 2 ends in 4 or 9, and in this event n 2 + 1 is divisible 
by 5. 

(c) n 1 — n = n(n — l)(n-hl)(n 2 — « + l)(n 2 + « + 1). If n is divi¬ 
sible by 7, or yields a remainder of 1 or 6 upon division by 7, then 
one of the first three factors on the right is divisible by 7. If n 
yields a remainder of 2 when divided by 7 (that is, n = 7k + 2), then 
n 2 yields a remainder of 4 when divided by 7 (that is, « 2 =49/& 2 +28&+4), 
and so n 2 + n + 1 is divisible by 7. Similar reasoning shows that if

must be divisible by k. In particular, if neither n nor m is divisible 
by 3, then m G0 — 1 = (m 30 ) 2 — 1 and n 60 — 1 = (« 30 ) 2 — 1 are divisible 
by 3; that is, m 60 and « 60 yield the same remainder, 1, upon division 
by 3. Hence, if mn is not divisible by 3, then m 60 — n 60 is divisible 
by 3, which means that in all cases mn(m fi0 — « 60 ) is divisible by 3. 
It can be shown, in the same way, that the difference 

n fo _ w 6o _ — (n lb y = (m l0 f — (w 10 ) 6 

- ( m e ) 10 - (« 6 ) 10 - ( w 5 ) 12 - ( w 5 ) 12 

is divisible by 5 in the event that neither m nor n is divisible by 5, 
and is divisible by 7 if 7 fails to divide either m or w, and the ana¬ 
logous conclusion holds for 11 and for 13. Thus, mn{m 60 — « 60 ) is 
divisible by 2-3-5-7-11-13. 

Divisibility of mn(m 60 — ;z 60 ) by 31 and by 61 is demonstrated in 
similar fashion (since n zl — n is, for all integral n f divisible by 31, 
and n 61 — n is, for all integral n , divisible by 61; problem 240). 

29. We shall use the identity 

n 2 + 3n + 5 = (n + 7)(n — 4) + 33 . 

If this number is to be divisible by 11, then for the suitable 
n , (w + 7)(» — 4) must be divisible by 11. Since (n -f 7)— («—4) = 11, 
either both terms are divisible by 11 or neither is. Hence, if 
(n + 7 ){n — 4) is divisible by 11, then it is divisible also by 121, and 
{n + 7 ){n — 4) + 33 fails to be divisible by 121. 

30. The given expression factors to 

(m — 2 n){m — n){m + n)(m + 2n){m J r2n) . 

If n =f= 0, no two of these factors are equal. However, the integer 
33 can be factored only as a product of at most four factors: 

33 = ( —ll)-3-l-(—11) , 
or 

33 = 11 -(— 3)-1 ■( —1) . 

If n — 0, the given expression becomes which cannot equal 33 
for any integral value of m. 

31. Every integer is either divisible by 5 or else can be represented 
in one of the forms 5k + 1, 5k + 2, 5& — 2, or 5k — 1. If the number 
is divisible by 5, then its 100th power is divisible by 5 3 = 125; hence, 
we need only investigate the case for integers not divisible by 5.

only these) satisfy the conditions of the problem. 

34. The two final digits of N 20 can be found in the following 
manner. The number A '' 20 is divisible by 4 (since N is even); fur¬ 
ther, N is not divisible by 5 (since then it would be divisible by 10, 
which denies the hypothesis). Hence, N is representable in the form 
5k zLl or 5k ±:2 (see the solution of problem 31). The number 

20*19 

(5k ± l ) 20 = (5 &) 20 ± ^yy-(5 &) 19 + • ■ • 

90*19

yields the same remainder upon division by 25 as does 
2 20 = (2 10 ) 2 = (1024) 2 - (1025 - l ) 2 , 

that is, 1. Since iV 20 yields the remainder 1 upon division by 25, it 
follows that the final two digits of this number can be only 01, 26, 51, 
or 76. In asmuch as jV 20 is divisible by 4, the possibilities narrow 
down to the number 76(since a number is divisible by 4 if, and only 
if, the number formed by its final two digits is so divisible). This 
yields 7 as the digit standing in the tens place of jV 20 . 

We shall now find the final three digits of iV 200 . The number iV 200 
is divisible by 8 . Further, since N and 5 are relatively prime, it 
follows that N L0Q yields the remainder 1 upon division by 125 (see 
the solution of problem 31); that is, W 100 = 125& + 1. But TV 200 — 
(125& + l ) 2 = (125&) 2 + 250& + 1 also yields the remainder 1 upon divi¬ 
sion by 125. Therefore, the only possibilities for the final three 
digits of W 200 are 126, 251, 376, 501, 626, 751, and 876. Since W 200 is 
divisible by 8 , it is clear that W 200 ends in 376, Thus, the digit in 
the hundreds place of W 200 is 3. 

Remark : It is easily reasoned that the number N 100 must end with the 
digits 376.

We first note that for odd k, + b‘ is divisible by « + b. Two 
cases will now be examined. 

n is an even integer. Here, the sum S* is divisible by n + 1, since 
each of the sums 


P + »*, 2 k +(n- 1)‘, 3 k + (n- 2)‘, 


is divisible by

N - «„-10 n + a.-JO"-* + a B _ 2 10^ z + ... +«,10 + a 0

Solutions (35-38) 


125 


(that is, the algebraic sum, taken with alternating signs, of the digits 
of N). A simple regrouping of terms yields 

N-M= flt(10 + 1) + af 10 2 - 1) + a 3 (10 3 + 1) 

+ fl4 ( 10* - 1) + • * • + a n ( 10 ± 1) , 

which is divisible by 11 since each term on the right is divisible by 
11 . [In fact, upon division by 11, 10 fc = (11 — l) fc yields the remainder 
— 1 if k is odd and the remainder 1 if k is even, as binomial expan¬ 
sion will show.] The number N is divisible by 11 if, and only if, 

the number M is divisible by 11 (zero, of course, is considered divisible 
by all nonzero integers). A criterion, then, is as follows: A number N 
is divisible by 11 if, and only if, the difference of the sum of digits in 
the odd-number (1st, 3rd, 5th, *••) positions and the sum of digits in 
the even-number (2nd, 4th, ■••) positions is divisible by 11. 

37. The number 15 yields the remainder 1 upon division by 7; it 
follows that 

15 2 = (7-2 + 1M7-2 + 1) = 7«! + 1 

also yields the remainder 1 upon division by 7, as does 

15 3 = 15 2 *15 = (7 n x + 1M7-2 + 1 ) = 7w 2 + 1 . 

It is now easily verified that every power of 15 yields the remainder 
1 upon division by 7. Now if the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + 4+ *•■ +14 = 
105 is subtracted from the given number, the difference can, after some 
simple regrouping and factoring, be displayed in the form 

13(15 - 1) + 12(15 2 - 1) + 11(15 3 - 1) + • • • 

+ 2(15 1Z - 1) + 1(15 13 - 1) , 

that is, each term is divisible by 7. But since the difference between 
the given number and the (decimal) number 105(= 7*15) is divisible 
by 7, it follows that the given number is also divisible by 7. 

38. Let K be an digit integer. In the set of natural numbers 
containing n + 2 digits and beginning with the digits 10 (that is, 
with numbers of aspect 10 a^a t • • • a n , this notation indicating the in¬ 
teger l- 10 n+2 + ar 10 n + a 2 'lO n ~ l + * * • +«„) there can always be found 
at least one digit which is divisible by the n-digit number K. Sup¬ 
pose this number is 10&i b 2 - * * b n . Then, to satisfy the conditions of 
the problem, both the numbers bih-'-bnlO and bib 2 * ■ • b n 0 1 would 
have to be divisible by K. Their difference is 9, which then also 
must be divisible by K . Since the only divisors of 9 are 1 , 3, and 



126 The Divisibility of Integers 

9, these are the only numbers which can satisfy the conditions of 
the problem. 

39. We must show that the number 

N= 27,195 a - 10,887 9 + 10,152 3 

is divisible by 26,460 = 2 2 *3 3 *5 *7 2 . The proof will be given in two 
steps: 

(1) N= 27,195 3 -(10,887 3 -10,152 s ). Now, 27,195 = 3-5*7 2 -37, and 
so this number is divisible by 5*7 2 The difference shown in the 
parentheses is divisible by 

10,887 - 10,152 = 735 = 3*5 *7 2 

(since a 2n — b Zn is divisible by a — b). Hence, N is divisible by 5*7 2 . 

(2) iV=(27,195 9 —10,887 s )+ 10,152 3 . Now, 10,152 = 2 3 *3 a *47 is divisible 
by 2 2 -3\ The difference shown in the parentheses is divisible by 

27,195 - 10,887 = 16,308 - 2 2 -3 3 -151 . 

Thus, N is divisible by 2 2 *3 3 . 

Since N is divisible by 5*7 2 and by 2 2 *3 3 , it follows that N is divi¬ 
sible by the product of these (relatively prime) numbers, and this 
product is 26,460. 

40. It is readily verified that 

llio _ po = (ii _ i)(H 9 + ip + iv + ■ • • + ll 2 + 11 + 1) . 

The second factor of the right number is divisible by 10, since it is 
the sum of ten integers each ending with the digit 1. Inasmuch as 
both factors on the right are divisible by 10, their product is divisi¬ 
ble by 100. Therefore, ll 10 —1 is divisible by 100. Therefore, ll 10 —1 
is divisible by 100. 

41. We have 

2222 s555 + 55 5 5 2222 = (22 2 2 555 + 4 555 ) 

+ (5555 2222 - 4 2222 ) - (4 5555 - 4 2222 ) . 

Consider the three terms enclosed by parentheses. The first is 
divisible by 2222 + 4 = 2226 = 7-318 (since a 11 + b n is divisible by a + b 
if n is odd), and so this term is divisible by 7. The second term is 
also divisible by 7, since it is divisible by 5555-4 — 5551 = 7*793 
(, a n — b n is always divisible by a—b). The third term may be written 

42222(43333 __ i) = 42222(041111 _ i) . 

clearly it is divisible by 64 — 1 = 63, and hence by 7. 


Solutions (39-44) 


127 


42. We use mathematical induction. The number aaa , consisting 
of three identical digits (the overbar indicating, as before, that the 
integer is given by the succession of digits shown), is divisible by 3 
(since the sum of these digits is 3 a, which is divisible by 3). Assume 
that the proposition has been proved for any integer consisting of 
3 * identical digits. The expanded integer consisting of 3 n+1 identical 
digits can be written in the following form: 

aa ■ • • a aa • ■ • a aa • * • a = aa • ■ ■ a- 100 • • * 0100j^J31 . 

3* times 3* times 3* times 3“ times 3" digits 3 * digits 

There are two factors on the right. The first factor is divisible by 3*, 
according to the induction hypothesis. The second factor is divisible 
by 3 (the sum of its digits being 3). Therefore, the product is divi¬ 
sible by 3 ttM . 

43. First note that 10 6 - 1 = 999 999 is divisible by 7 (in fact, 
999 999 = 7 • 142,857). It follows that 1(F (for any integer N) yields 
upon division by 7 the same remainder as does 10 r , where r is the 
remainder obtained by division of N by 6 , since if N = 6k + r, then 

1(F - 10 r = 10 6fc+r - 10 r = 10 r (10 8ft - 1) , 

and since 10 6 * - 1 = ( 10 ®)* - 1 is divisible by 10 6 - 1 , which in turn 
is divisible by 7, then 10 lV — 10 r is divisible by 7. This means that 
10 iV and 10 r yield the same remainder upon division by7. f 

Now, it is readily verified that every integral power of 10 yields 
a remainder of 4 upon division by 6 (that is, 10 = 4 mod 6 ). The 
exponents of each term of the sum given in the problem are all 
powers of 10, hence each exponent is congruent to 4 modulo 6 . This 
means that we can replace each of the ten terms by 10 4 in order to 
find the remainder upon division by 7. We have 

10 4 + 10 4 + ■ ■ • + 10 4 - 10 s 1,000,000 = 7-14,285 + 5 . 

^ ■ -y “ —^

Therefore, the remainder is 5.

The Divisibility of Integers 


and therefore ends with the digit 1. Any odd power of 9 can be 
written as 9 2n+l = 9*81* and therefore ends with the digit 9. Since 
9 (s9) is an odd power of 9, it must end with the digit 9. 

It is obvious that I6 n ends with the digit 6 for all n ^ 1. Hence 
any power of 2 whose exponent is a multiple of 4 (that is, 2 4n ) ends 
with 6 , since 2* n — 16". Now, 3 4 — 1 is divisible by 3 + 1 = 4, and so 
2 < 3 *) _ 2 - 2 (34_l) , which is the product of 2 and an integer ending with 
6 , must end with 2 . 

(b) If we find the remainder yielded upon division of 2 999 by 100, 
it will be the number formed by the two final digits of 2 999 . We first 
show, that the number 2 I00 ° yields the remainder 1 upon division by 
25. In fact, 2 10 + 1 = 1024 + 1 = 1025 is divisible by 25; and so 
2 20 —1 = (2 10 + 1 )( 2 10 — 1 ) is divisible by 25. Thus, 2 1000 - 1 = (2 20 ) 50 - 1 , 
being divisible by 2 20 — 1, is also divisible by 25, and so upon divi¬ 
sion by 25 the number 2 1000 yields the remainder 1. 

It follows that the final two digits of 2 1000 can be only 01, or 
01 + 25 = 26, or 01 + 50 = 51, or 01 + 75 = 76. Since 2 1000 is divisible 
by 4, the only possibility among these four numbers is 76. Thus, 2 999 
is the quotient obtained by dividing an integer ending in 76 by 2. 
The only possibilities are 38 and 88 . Since 2 999 is divisible by 4, 
there remains the one possibility, 88 , for the final two digits. 

As above, we investigate the remainder obtained upon dividing 
3"9 by 100. We recall that every even power of 9 ends with the 
digit 1 and that every odd power ends with the digit 9 [see the 
solution to problem (a)]. Now consider the remainder obtained upon 
division of 9 s + 1 by 100. We have 

9 5 + 1 = (9 + 1)*(9 4 - 9 3 + 9 2 - 9 + 1) 

= 10*(9 4 - 9 3 + 9 2 - 9 + 1) . 

The numbers 9\ 9 2 , and 1 all end with the digit 1 , and the numbers 
9 3 and 9 end with 9. Thus, 9 4 + 9 2 + 1 ends with 3, and 9 3 + 9 ends 
with 8 , which means that the number 9 4 — 9 3 + 9 2 — 9 + 1 must end 
with 5. Accordingly, 9 5 + 1 must yield upon division by 100 the 
remainder 10-5 = 50. It follows that 9 10 — 1 = (9 5 + l)-(9 5 — 1 ) is di¬ 
visible by 100, and since 3 1000 — 1 = 9™° — 1 = (9 10 ) 50 — 1 is divisible 
by 9 10 — 1, it follows that 3 1000 — 1 is divisible by 100. Thus, 3 1000 
ends with the digits 01. But this number is, of course, divisible by 
3; consequently, the carry-over from the hundreds place of 3 1000 to 
the tens place must be 2 (if it were 0 or 1, then 3 1000 would not be 
divisible by 3). Therefore, the number 3 999 = 3 1000 /3 must end with 
the same two digits as the number 201/3 = 67.

(c) We must find the remainder, upon division by 100, of 
the number 14 tl4U) = (7*2) (14l4) . First we find the remainders, upon 

division by 100, of 7 <14l4) and 2 ( 14 ). 

The number 7 4 - 1 = 2401 - 1 = 2400 is divisible by 100. It follows 
that if k = 4 * (k being an integer), then 7' - 1 is divisible by 100 
(since 7 >k — 1 = (7 4 ) fc — 1* is divisible by 7 4 — 1). Now, 14“ — 2 “-7 
is divisible by 4; consequently, 7'““' - 1 is divisible by 100, which 
means that 7 , “ l, > ends with the digits 01 . 

In the solution of part (b) it was shown that 2" - 1 is divisible 
by 25; hence, if » = 20k , then 2" - 1 is divisible by 25 We will 
now find the remainder obtained from division of 14“ by 20. Clearly, 
14n = 214.714. But 2“ = 4-2 lz . Since 2‘ 2 - 1 = (2*) 3 - 1 is divisible 
by 2 4 — 1 = 16 — 1 = 15, it follows that 4(2 12 - 1) is divisible by 20, 
and consequently 2 “ = 4 - 2 “ yields upon division by 20 a remainder 
of 4 Further 7 14 = 49-7 12 . Since 7 12 yields a remainder of 1 upon 
division by 20 (12 is divisible by 4, whence 7“ - 1 is divisible by 
100 ) it follows that 49 - 7 “ yields upon division by 20 the same re¬ 
mailer as does 49, that is, 9. Similarly, 14“ = 2“-7“ yields upon 
division by 20 the same remainder as does the product 4-9 - 3b, that 
is 16- or 14“ = 20k + 16. It follows that 2'““' = 2“-2 z »‘ yields upon 
division by 25 the same remainder as does 2 16 = 65,536; that is, 2'“^’ 
can end only with one of the numbers 11, 36, 61, or 86. Since 2 
is divisible by 4, the final two digits must be 36. 

Therefore, since 7'““' ends with the digits 01, and 2 has as 
its two final digits 36, the product 7-““' -2*““’ = 14'““’ ends with 36. 

45 . (a) We make use of the fact that the product of two numbers 

ending respectively with the digits a and b will have the same fina 
digit as does the product a-b. This provides a simple solution for 
the problem. We consider successively greater powers of 7, keeping 
track of the final digit only: 7‘ ends with the digit 9; 7 3 = 7-7 z with 
the digit 3; 7* = 7-7 3 with the digit 1; and 7 7 - 7‘-7 3 with the digit . 

Moreover, we find that (7 7 ) 7 ends with the digit 7 [(7 7 ) 3 ends with 
9 * ( 7 7 ) 3 ends with 7; (7 7 ) 4 ends with 1, and, finally, (7 7 ) 7 ends with ]. 
We find, at the next stage, that the number ((7 7 ) 7 ) 7 ends with the 
same digit as does 7 7 (the digit 3), and the number (((7 7 ) 7 ) 7 ) 7 ends 
again with the digit 7, and so on. Continuation of this process must 
then yield the following rule. For an odd number of exponents 7 
we obtain a final digit 3, and for an even number of exponents we 
obtain a final digit 7. Since 1000 is an even integer, the number 
sought has 7 as its final digit.

The Divisibility of Integers 


If an integer ends with a two-digit number A, and another integer 
ends with a two-digit number B, then the product of the two integers 
ends with the same two-dight number as does the product A-B. 
This fact allows us to find the final two digits for the number 
mentioned by the problem. We easily verify, by the methods used 
above, that V ends with the two-digit number 43, and (7 7 ) 7 ends with 
the same two digits as does 43 7 , namely 07. It follows that in taking 
successive 7th powers, 7, 7 7 , (7 7 ) 7 , * * •, we obtain for an odd number of 
such “raises” a number with final digits 43, and for an even number 
a number with final digits 07. Therefore, the number in which we 
are interested must end with 07. 

(b) In the solution of problem (a) we saw that 7 A ends with 
the digit 1 . Therefore, 7 Ak = (7 A ) k also ends with the dight 1, and 
7 4fc+r , where k is one of the numbers 0,1, 2, or 3, ends with the same 
digit as does 7 r (since 7 Ak+r = 7 4 fc *7 r ). Thus, the problem reduces to 
finding the remainder, modulo 4 (that is, after division by 4), of the 
“exponential part” of the given number. 

The power to which 7 is raised is again a power of 7. We must 
determine the remainder obtained by dividing the latter power by 4. 
Now 7 = 8 — 1, and it follows that: 7 2 = (8 — 1)*(8 — 1) yields upon 
division by 4 the remainder 1; 7 3 = 7 2 -(8 — 1) yields upon division by 
4 the remainder —1 (equivalent, upon division by 4, to the remainder 
3); and, in general, every even power of 7 yields upon division by 4 
the remainder 1 , and odd powers yield the remainder —1 (that is, 
+ 3). For the number in question, we are concerned with an odd 
power of 7, since the exponential part is itself a power of 7, and, 
consequently, owing to the conditions of the problem, it is of form 
74 A .+3 Therefore, it ends with the same digit as does 7\ that is, 
with the digit 3. 

Since 7 A ends with 01, 7 Ak + r ends with the same two-digit number 
as does 7 r . Therefore, the given number ends with the same two 
digits as does 7 3 , that is, 43. 

46. Consider the following five numbers: 

(1) Z< = 9 . 

( 2 ) Z 2 = 9*i = (10 - l)*i 

= 10*i - -10*!- 1 + ■ ■ • + TO — 1 

(where the integers not explicitly displayed are obviously divisible 
by 100). Now, — 9, and hence the two final digits of Z 2 are the 
same as the final two digits of 9-10 — 1 = 89.

The Divisibility of Integers 


Further, since the final four digits of the number Z% coincide with 
the final four digits of Z 4 , it follows that the final five digits of the 
number Z 6 = 9^ = (10 — l) z s coincide with the final five digits of the 
number Z 5 (=9^). It can be shown, inexactly the same way, that 
all the numbers of the sequence 

Z 5 ; Z 6 = 9-^5; Z 7 = 9*o; - * ■; Ziooo = 9^m; Z l0 oi = 9^iooo 

end with the same four digits, namely the digits forming the number 
45,289. Thus, Ziooi is the number N called for by our problem.

Now 1/49 forms a periodic decimal; it is found (by tedious but 
straightforward division) to have a period of 42 digits;

or, in abbreviated form 


where P expresses the 42 digits written above. 

The multiple of 42 nearest 1000 is 1008 = 24-42. Consequently,

repeating groups of 42 digits each (the number M consists not of 
1008 digits but of 1007, since the number P begins with a zero). 

We construct the difference between the number N in which we

the product of all the integers from 1 to 100 (that is, in 100.) e 
factor 2 enters to a higher power than does 5. Hence 100 is divisi¬

in thik manv zeros). Up to and including 100, there are 20 integers 
which are multiples of 5. Four of these (25, 50, 75 ' a ^ 10 ^ are alsO

Alternate solution of problems (a) and ( b) using the result of problem 
101. Problem (b) will be considered first. The power m to which 
the prime p is a factor of a\ is, as we have seen, equal to m = 
m i + m 2 + where m v is the number of integers of the sequence 
1,2, a of which p is at least a simple factor; m 2 is the number 
of integers of which p 2 is a factor; and so on. The number of inte¬

The proposition of problem (a) immediately follows. Consider the

(c) («!)! is the product of the first nl integers. These nl 
integers can be written as the product of (n — 1 )! product sets each 
containing nl successive integers. Each of these sets is, according 
to the solution of problem (a), divisible by nl. 

(d) Designate the integers by a, a + d, a + 2d, •■■,a + (n — 1 )d. 
We first show that there exists an integer k such that the product 
kd yields a remainder 1 when divided by nl. Consider the (nl — 1) 
numbers d, 2d, 3</,••■, (nl - 1 )d. None of these numbers is divisible 
by nl (since d and nl are, by hypothesis, relatively prime). Further, 
no two products pd and qd, where p and q are distinct integers less 
than nl, can yield the same remainder upon division by nl (otherwise 
pd — qd = (p — q)d would be divisible by «!). Hence the nl — 1 inte¬ 
gers all yield different remainders upon division by nl, and so, for 
some k, the remainder 1 appears upon division by nl, that is, kd = 
r-nl + 1 . 

If now we designate ka by A, we have 
ka — A 

k(a + d) — A + kd = (A + \) + r-nl , 
k(a + 2d) = A + 2kd = (A + 2) + 2r-nl ,

k[a + (n- 1W] = A + (n — 1 )kd = [A + (w - D] + (n - D r-nl .

gives the same remainder upon division by nl as does 
A(A + 1)(A + 2 ) • - • [A + (w - D] • 

The latter product is divisible by nl, in view of the result of problem 
(a); also k" is relatively prime to nl (since if k is not relatively prime 
to nl, then neither is kd). Therefore, nl divides a(a + d)(a + 2d) 

[a + (n - l)<f].

The Divisibility of Integers 


Since 7 is a prime number, the highest power of 7 which is a factor 
of 1000! [see the second solution of problem 49 (b)] is equal to 

The highest power of 7 in 500! is equal to 

and so the degree to which 7 enters the denominator of the fraction 
is 82*2 = 164. Thus, both numerator and denominator contain the 
factor 7 exactly the same number of times. When 7 164 is cancelled 
out of numerator and denominator, no multiple of 7 remains in the 
resulting number. Therefore, the integer represented by CfSoo is not 
divisible by 7. 

51. (a) It is readily seen that every prime number satisfies the 
given condition, since p does not appear as a factor in (p — 1)!. If 
n is a composite number which can be written as the product of 
two unequal factors, a and b, then both a and b are less than n — 1 , 
and consequently, both appear in the composition of (n — 1)!. This 
means that (n — 1)! is divisible by ab = n. If n is the square of a 
prime p > 2 , then n — 1 = p 2 — 1 > 2p, which implies that both p 
and 2 p enter into the product composition of (n — 1)!. Hence, (n — 1)! 
is divisible by p*2p = 2 p 1 = 2n . Thus, all the composite numbers 
except 2 2 = 4 may be eliminated. However, 4 satisfies the condition 
of the problem, as well as do all the prime numbers less than 100: 

2, 3, 4, 7,11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31,37, 41, 

43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97 . 

(b) It will be shown that (n — 1 )! fails to be divisible by n 2 
in the following cases only: n is prime, n is twice a prime, n is the 
square of a prime, n — 8 , n — 9. 

If n is neither a prime number, nor twice a prime, nor the square 
of a prime, nor the numbers 8 or 16, then n may be written as a 
product a-b, where a and b are distinct numbers, neither of which 
is less than 3. Assume b > a ^ 3. Then the numbers a, b, 2a r 2b, 3 a 
are all less than n — 1 ; moreover, a, b, and 2b are clearly distinct 
from each other, and at least one of the numbers 2a or 3 a differs 
from a, b, and 2b. Hence, in (n — 1)! there appear the distinct factors 
a, b, 2b, 2a, or else a,b,2b,3a (and possibly all of a, b, 2a, 2b, and 3 a 


Solutions (51-52) 


137 


appear separately as factors of that product). In every case. (» - 1)! 
is divisible by aPb 2 = « 2 . 

Moreover, if n = p\ where p > 4 is prime, then n - 1 > 4p, ana 
(n — 1 )' contains as factors all of the numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4p and hence 
is divisible by p* = n\ If » = 2 p, then (n - 1)! is not divisible by 
t 1 and so it is not divisible by >z 2 ; when n — 8 or n — 9, (w 1 ). is 
not divisible by n l ( 7 ! is not divisible by 8 2 , nor is 8 ! divisible by 
q, v if n = 16 (n- D! is divisible by « 2 (since 15! contains as factors 
the numbers 2,4 = 2 2 , 6 = 3-2 ,8 = 2°, 10 = 2-5.12 = 2 2 -3.14 = 2-7, and 

so is divisible by 2' +2+ — 2+1 = 2 “ = 16 2 -2 2 ) 

Thus, the condition of problem (b) is satisfied by all the numbers 
which satisfy the condition of problem (a), and in addition by t e 
integers 6,8,9,10,14,22, 26,34,38,46, 58,62, 74,82, 86 ,94, that is, all 
primes, doubles of primes, and the integers 8 and 9.

The Divisibility of Integers 


Inasmuch as n is divisible by K, we must have K fk n, whence 
(l/ n) L < n 2 . Therefore, / < 4. Since p u p 2 , • • • p h are primes less than 
1 /7T, pi = 7 > i/ n (the fourth prime number is 7), and so n < 49, 

If we examine the integers less than 49, we readily ascertain that 
only the following integers satisfy the conditions of the problem: 

24, 12,8,6,4,3,2 . 

53. (a) Designate five consecutive integers by 
n — 2 , n — 1 , n> n + 1 , n + 2 . 

Then 

(n - 2 ) 2 + (w - l ) 2 + n 2 + (n + l ) 2 + (n + 2 ) 2 = 5w 2 + 10 = 5 (n 2 + 2) . 

If 5 (n 2 + 2 ) is a perfect square, then it mush be divisible by 25 
(it has the prime factor 5, which must appear twice), hence (n 2 + 2) 
must be divisible by 5. This is possible only if the final digit of n 2 
is 8 or 3, and no square of an integer ends in either of these digits. 

(b) Of three consecutive integers, one is divisible by 3, an¬ 
other yields a remainder of 1 upon division by 3, and the third yields 
remainder of 2 (or, equivalently, a remainder of —1). Upon multi¬ 
plication of two such integers, the remainders obtained from division 
by any number are also multiplied; actually, 

(pk + r)(qk + s) = pqk z + pks + qkr + rs = k(pqk + ps + qr) + rs . 

Hence, if a number yields the remainder 1 upon division by 3, then 
all of its powers yield the remainder 1 upon division by 3; if the 
remainder is — 1 , then all of the odd powers of the number will 
yield the remainder — 1 , and the even powers will yield the re¬ 
mainder 1 . 

Thus, given three even powers of consecutive integers, we have, 
upon division by 3, the remainder 0 for one power and the remainder 
1 for the other two. 

Therefore, the sum of even powers of three consective integers 
yields the remainder 2 when divided by 3 (or, equivalently, the re¬ 
mainder — 1 ); but no even power of any integer, as we have just 
shown, can yield this remainder upon division by 3. 

Remark : The even powers referred to in problem (b) need not be the same. 
In problem (c) note that the even powers referred to are all the same. 

(c) As we saw in the solution of problem (a), the sum of 
even powers of three consecutive integers yields a remainder of 2 


Solutions (53-54)

when divided by 3. It follows that the sum of even powers of nine 
consecutive numbers yield a “remainder” of 6 upon division by 3, 
that is, this sum is divisible by 3. We must show that such a sum 
(wherein the even powers are the same) is not divisible by 3 2 = 9. 

Of nine consective integers, one is divisible by 9, and the others 
yield remainders from 1 to 8. If 2k is the (even) power to which 
the nine consecutive integers are raised, then the sum yields the 
same remainder upon division by 9 as does 

0 + l 2 * + 2 ik + 3“ + 4“ + 5“ + 6“ + 7 2t + 8 2 * 1 

or the sum 

2(1* + 4 * + 7*) 

(since 3 2 and 6 2 are divisible by 9; l 2 and 8 2 = 64 each yield a re¬ 
mainder 1; 2 2 = 4 and 7 2 = 49 yield remainders of 4; 4 2 = 16 and 
52 = 25 yield remainders of 7). 

Now note that l 3 = 1, 4 3 = 64, and 7 3 = 343 all yield the remainder 
1 upon division by 9. It follows that if k = 3/, then 1+4+7 
V + 64' + 343' yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does 
_|_ \i = 3 ; it is not divisible by 9. If k — 3/ + 1, then l k + 4 fc + 
yjt 64+4 + 343'*7 yields the same remainder as does the sum 

1-1 + 1-4 + i -7 = 12; it is not divisible by 9. If k = 3/ + 2 , then 
p _l_ 4 * + 7 * = 1+1 + 64'-4 2 + 343'-7 2 yields the same remainder upon 
division by 9 as does the sum M + 1-16 + 1*49 = 66 ; it is not divisi¬ 
ble by 9. 

54 . (a) The sum of the digits of each number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 

5 + 6 + 7 = 28. It follows that both numbers yield a remainder of 
1 upon division by 9 (an integer yields the same remainder upon 
division by 9 as does the sum of its digits). But if AIB - n, or 
A = nB, where n is an integer different from 1, then, since B - 
9N + l, it follows from A = nB=9M+n that n must yield a re¬ 
mainder of 1 upon division by 9. The least value which n can as- 
sume is 10. However, AIB < 10, inasmuch as A and B are both 
seven-digit numbers. 

(b) Designate the integers sought by N,2N,3N. Since an integer 
yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does the sum o 
its digits, the sum N + 2N + 3N must yield the same remainder 
upon division by 9 as does 1 + 2 + 3+ ••• + 9 = 45 in order to meet 
the condition imposed by the problem. Hence, 6 N (and consequently 
3N) is divisible by 9. 

Since 3N is to be a three-digit number, the first digit of N cannot 




140 


141 


The Divisibility of Integers 

exceed 3. It follows that the last digit of N cannot be 1, since the 
integer 2N would end with 2 and 3N would end with 3, and then 
none of these three digits is available to begin N. The integer N 
cannot terminate with 5, since 2N would end with 0. Assume now 
that the final digit of N is 2; then the final digits of 2 N and 3N are, 
respectively, 4 and 6. The remaining two digits for 3N can be chosen 
only from 1,3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Since the sum of all the digits of 3N 
must be a multiple of 9, the first two digits of 3N are either 3 and 
9 or 5 and 7. By checking all the possibilities, we find that the 
following three-digit numbers satisfy the condition of the problem: 
192, 384, 576. Analogously, we can investigate the cases for which 
N terminates with 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9. This procedure will produce 
three additional solutions: 273, 546, 819; 327, 654, 981; and 219,438,657. 

55. A perfect square can terminate in only one of the digits 
0,1,4, 9, 6, or 5. Moreover, the square of an even integer is obvi¬ 
ously divisible by 4, and the square of an odd integer yields the 
remainder 1 upon division by 4 [since (2k + l) 2 = A(k 2 + k) + 1]. Hence, 
no square can end with any of the pairs 11, 99, 66, or 55, since 
numbers ending in the digits 11,99,66, or 55 yield upon division by 
4 the respective remainders 3, 3, 2, and 3). 

We now investigate which remainders are possible when a perfect 
square is divided by 16. Every integer can be represented in one 
of the following forms: 

8k , 8k ± 3 , 

8k±l , 8k ± 4 . 

8k ±2 , 

The squares of these numbers have the following forms: 

16(4& 2 ) , 16(4£ 2 zt 3k) + 9 , 

16(4& 2 ±k) + l, 16(4& 2 ± 4A + 1) . 

16(4A’ 2 ± 2k) + 4 , 

These forms show that the square of an integer is either divisible 
by 16 or will yield a remainder of 1, 4, or 9 when divided by 16. The 
possibility of ending with 1 or 9 has been excluded. A number ending 
with the succession of digits 4444 yields a remainder of 12 upon 
division by 16 and therefore must also be eliminated as a possibility 
for a perfect square. 

Therefore, if a perfect square ends with four identical digits, then 


Solutions (55-56) 

these digits must be zeros (for example, 100 2 = 10,000). 

56. First solution. We designate the sides of the rectangle by * 
and y, and the diagonal by z. According to the Pythagorean Theorem, 

x 2 + y 2 = z 2 

We are to prove that the product xy is divisible by 12. We shall 
first show that xy is divisible by 3, then that it is divisible by 4. 
Since 

(3k + l) 2 = 3(3k 2 + 2k) + 1 , 

and 

(3k + 2) 2 = 3(3k 2 + 4k + 1) + 1 , 

the square of every integer which is not a multiple of 3 yields a 
remainder of 1 upon division by 3. Therefore, if neither x nor y is 
divisible by 3, then the sum x z + y z will yield a remainder of 2 when 
divided by 3 and thus cannot be the square of any integer. Hence, 
a necessary condition for x 2 + y z to be the square of an integer 2 is 
that at least one of x or y be a multiple of 3, which in turn means 
that xy is divisible by 3. 

Further, not both x and y can be odd numbers, since if x - 2m + 1 
and y = 2n + 1, then 

j ^2 jy 2 — + 4 vn + 1 + 4 n z + 4 n + 1 

= 4 (m z + n + n z + n) + 2 , 

which cannot be the square of an integer (the square of an odd 
number is odd, and the square of an even number is divisible by 4). 
If both x and y are even, then their product is certainly divisible 
by 4. Assume then that x is even and y is odd. We have x = 2m, 
y = 2n + 1. The number z 2 (and hence z) is then odd (the sum of 
even and odd). If we write z = 2p + 1, we have 

(2m) 2 = (2p + l) 2 - (2n + l) 2 

= 4 p 2 + 4/> 4- 1 — 4m 2 — 4n — 1 , 

or 

m 2 = p(p + 1) - n(n + 1) . 

It follows that m 2 is an even number (each term of the above differ¬ 
ence is the product of two consecutive integers and so is even). 
Therefore, since m is even, x = 2m is divisible by 4, and so the 
product xy is divisible by 4. 



142 


The Divisibility of Integers 

Second solution. It follows from the formulas of the solution of 
problem 128 (a) that the sides x and y of such a rectangle can have 
lengths expressible as x = 2 tab, y = t(a 2 — ft 2 ), where t, a, b are any 
integers for which a and b are relatively prime. [The diagonal length 
is then the integer t(a 2 + ft*).] If at least one of the integers a or b 
is even, then x is divisible by 4. If both a and b are odd, then x 
is divisible by 2 and y is divisible by 2, hence xy is divisible by 4. 
Further, if either a or ft is divisible by 3, then x is divisible by 3; 
if neither a nor ft is divisible by 3, then: one of them yields a re¬ 
mainder of 1 when divided by 3 and the other a remainder of 2, 
or else both yield the same remainder. In both cases y = t(a + b){a — ft) 

is divisible by 3. Therefore, in every case the product xy is divisi¬ 
ble by 12. 

We see from the formula giving the roots of a quadratic 
equation, 


x = ~^ ± I/ft 2 — 4ac 
2a 

that the roots of the given quadratic equation will be rational if, 
and only if, the discriminant ft 2 = tec is a perfect square. Let ft = 
^ + 1, a = 2 p -f- 1, c = 2q + 1. Then we can write: 

ft 2 - 4a c = (2n + l) 2 - 4(2 p + l)(2q + 1) 

= 4« 2 + 4 n - l&pq - 8p - 8q - 3 

= 8 (- !! ^-2A,- P - ? - 1 ) + 5 , 

Since this number is odd IliEJ: 1) j s integral, since one of the 

factors of the numerator is necessarily evenj, it can be the square 

of an odd number only. Now, every odd number can be written as 
4k zt 1, and so the square of an odd number has the form 

(4k zt l) 2 = 16k 2 zt 8k + 1 = 8(2k z dz k) -f 1 . 

That is, the square of an odd number always yield the remainder 1 
upon division by 8. Therefore, since b 2 - 4 ac is odd, but yields a 
remainder of 5 upon division by 8, it cannot be a perfect square.

Solutions (57-59) 


143 


The numerator of this fraction is clearly not divisible by 3, but the 
denominator is divisible by 3 (being the product of three consecutive 
integers). Hence, since there is an uncancelled factor in the denomi¬ 
nator of the reduced fraction which differs from 2 and 5, the decimal 
representation certainly is nonterminating. We shall show that the 
denominator is not relatively prime to 10, hence that the period of 
the decimal expansion is a deferred one. 

Of the two integers n and n + 1, one must be even and the other 
odd. If n is odd, then 3 n 2 is odd, and so the numerator of the 
fraction is odd; hence it has no factor 2. If n is even, then n + 2 
is divisible by 2, and the denominator is divisible by 2 2 . But the 
numerator is divisible only by 2, since if n =2&, then 

3 n 2 + 6n + 2= 12k 2 + 12k + 2 = 2(6k 2 + 6k + 1) ; 

and so the denominator has a factor of 2 not shared with the numer¬ 
ator. Therefore, the denominator of the reduced fraction is not rela¬ 
tively prime to 10, and so its representation as a decimal must have 
deferred periodicity.

we select that one whose denominator contains the highest power of 

2 as a factor; there can be only one such term. Now, if we rewrite 
each term of the sum so as to have as denominator the least common 
multiple of all the denominators, then each of them, save the selected 
fraction, will acquire the factor 2 in its numerator, but the selected 
fraction will acquire only odd factors. Therefore, when the fractions 
are added in this form, the resulting numerator will be the sum of 
several even numbers and exactly one odd number, but the (common) 
denominator will be even. Hence the numerator will be odd and the 
denominator even, and so the sum cannot be an integer. 

(c) Consider that term of the summation whose denominator 
contains as a factor the highest power (say n) of 3. Since all the 
denominators are odd, no fraction of form can appear as a term 
of the sum K, If we obtain the least common multiple of all the 
denominators, and express all the fractions with this denominator, 
then each of them, except the selected fraction, will acquire a factor 

3 in its numerator, but the numerator of the selected fraction will 
not have a factor 3. Consequently, we obtain for K a fraction whose

60. (a) We consider the sum using denominator (p — 1)! For the 
numerator of the sum we obtain the sum of all possible products of 
the numbers 1, 2, •••,/> — 1, taken p — 2 at a time. Since the de¬ 
nominator (p — 1)! of the sum is not divisible by p , we need only 
show that the sum of all distinct products of 1, 2, •••,/> — 1, taken 
p — 2 at a time, is divisible by p 2 .

are divisible by p , and that Tll~ l itself is divisible by p 2 . The as¬

Consider the polynomial 

P(x) = {x- l)u - 2)U - 3) . •. (X - n) . 

If this product is multiplied out, we obtain 

P(x) = x n - n\x n - 1 + nlx n ~ z - ■ ■ • + nl

Consider, further, the expression P(x)[x — (w + 1)]. This can be 
expanded in two ways: 

P(x)[x - (n + 1)] - (x n - n\x n ~ l + nlx n - 2 - ■ ■ ■ + nl)[x - (n + 1)] ,

If two polynomials are equal for all x, then they are identical- 

we can equate the coefficients of like powers of x from both sides 
(designating by CT = C) the (m + l)st binomial coefficient), and obtain 
the following system of equations:

tj^~ 1 by p.

But n P Z\ = (p — 1)!. If we cancel (p — 1)! from both sides, factor 
out p, transpose n v P z\ to the left side, and so on, we obtain 

n p P z\ = p(p>- 3 - n^pr-* + nl-.p^ -+ n p :\), 

from which we find that n v p Z\ is divisible by p 2 (the expression in

(b) Using the common denominator [(p - l)!] 2 , we arrive at 

a sum

where A is the sum of all possible products containing p — 2 distinct 
factors taken from the numbers l 2 , 2 2 , 3 2 , •••,(/> — l) 2 (or, as charac¬ 
terized before, “taken p - 2 at a time”). To show that A is divisible 
by p , we shall consider the square of the sum n p v z\ [the terminology 
has the same meaning as in problem (a)]. Since the square of a 
polynomial is equal to the sum of the squares of its individual terms 
plus twice the sum of all possible pairwise products of the terms, 
the sum ( n £“ 2 ) 2 consists of the terms of A plus a series of numbers 
(all the possible doubled products). We consider one of these doubled 
products: 

211-2 ■■•(;- l)(f + 1) ■■•(/>- U] x [1-2 * * ■(; - 1)0’ + 1) D] .

Summing all such terms shows that

whence 

A = (/ 7 p “-?) 2 — 2(p — l)!/7plj . 

In view of what has been proved in problem (a), A is divisible by

Continuation of this procedure leads to examination of 1 /a, which 
clearly is irreducible for any integer a. 

62. We first show that, for any integer b f the number of differences 
a k — a t which are divisible by b is not less than the number of 
differences k — l which are divisible by b. We first determine how 
many differences a k — ai are divisible by b . 

Assume that n 0 of the integers a u a ly ■*■,£» are divisible by b y 
that of them yield the remainder 1 upon division by b y that n 2 of 
them yield the remainder 2, and so on up to Hi -1 integers that yield 
a remainder of b — 1 when divided by b . Since an integer yields 
precisely one of the remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, 1 upon division by 

b y it is clear that 

H 0 + Hi + H 2 + • ■ • + Hi-1 = H . 

The difference a k — a t is divisible by b if, and only if, the two 
terms yield the same remainder upon division by b . The number of 
differences a k — ai divisible by b since both terms are divisible by 
b will be designated by Cl 0 = —— [clearly, there are 1 + 2 + 

■ ■ * + (h 0 — 1) of them]; the number of differences a k — ai divisible by

which give a remainder of k upon division by b. 

It follows immediately from the formula just obtained that if n = mb 
(that is, if n is a multiple of b ), then the number N is not less than 
N f , The numbers Wo> Wi, * ■ ■, n f b-i are all equal to w, and consequently 
the sum of the squares of the pairwise differences of the numbers 
vanishes. It is less obvious that if n yields the remainder r * 0 
upon division by b (that is, n = mb + r, 0 < r < b), we obtain the 
inequality N l . Here, r of the numbers w£, n[, — (in par-

ticular, the numbers n[ t n[ t • ••, n f r ) are equal to m + 1, and the re¬ 
maining numbers, no, n' r +u • ■ •, w£-i, are equal to m. In order to prove 
that cannot be less than N f , we employ the following formal method. 

Since the sum of the b numbers n Qt n lf is equal to n = 

mb -H r, at least one of these numbers, say n tf does not exceed m [other¬ 
wise the sum of these numbers would be not less than b (m + 1) > n]. 
We now add one more number, a n +i, to the numbers a u a%, ••*,#*— 
a number giving a remainder of t upon division by b. Then the 
number of differences ak — at is augmented by the n differences; 
a n + L — a u a n+l — a Zy • • *, a n +1 — a n . Of these new differences exactly 
n t will be divisible by b. Now, the number of differences k — l is 
augmented by the n differences (n + 1) — 1, (n + 1) — 2, ■ • *, (n + 1) — «, 
and it is clear that m ^ n t of the differences will be divisible by b. 
Therefore, if we prove that at least as many of the ClUi differences, 
a k — au for k > / and k, l ~ 1, 2, ••*,« + 1, are divisible by b as before 
(that is, as among the differences a k — ai for k, 1 = 1, 2, • • •, n), then 
it will follow that of the number C» f of differences a k — ai (k > /; 
k, l = 1, 2, * - -, n) no fewer will be divisible by b than were divisible 
among the differences k — /, where k 7 1 = 1, 2, • ■ ■, n. If n + 1 is 
divisible by b y then our quest is ended: the result sought follows 
from what we have done (it is analagous to the case n = mb). If 
n + 1 fails to be divisible by b, then we adjoin another integer to 
the sequence a u ch 7 ■••,a n ,a n + 1,—and we may continue adjoining ad¬ 
ditional integers until their number does form a multiple of b. This 
completes the proof of the initial assertion. 

The proposition of the problem follows immediately. If b = p is 
any prime number, then p divides at least as many factors a k — ai 
as it does factors k — /; the same assertion will be true for p z , />\ 
Thus, every prime p will enter the numerator as a factor to an order 
at least as great as it enters the denominator; therefore, the denomi¬ 
nator of the fraction obtained by multiplying together all numbers 
of the form — ^ _Jj - will divide the numerator, and so that product 
will be an integer. 

63. The numbers of our sequence may be expressed in the form 
1 + 10 4 + 10 8 + - ■ - + I0* k . We shall investigate, along with these 
numbers, the integers of form 1 + 10 2 + 10 4 + 10 6 + * * ■ + 10 2 \ It is 
readily shown that 

10 u+4 - 1 = (10 4 - 1) ■ (1 + 10 4 + 10* + • ■ • + 10 4 *) , 

10 ** +2 - 1 = (10 2 - 1) • (1 + 10 2 + 10 4 + • * * + 10 2 *) .

Moreover, it is clear that 

10 44+4 - 1 = (10 24 + 2 - 1)(10 2 *+ 2 + 1). 

Comparison of these equalities yields 
10 u+4 - 1 = (10 4 - 1)(1 + 10 4 + 10 3 + • ■ ■ + 10 4t ) 

= (10 2 - 1)(1 + 10 2 + 10 4 + ■ ■ • + 10 2 *)(10 24 +2 + 1),

or, since -■ Q2 _ 1 = 10 z + 1 = 101, 

(1 + 10 4 + 10 8 + • • ■ + 10 4 *) ■ 101 

= (1 + 10 2 + 10 4 + ■ • • + 10 2 *)(10“+ 2 + 1). 

Since 101 is a prime number, either 1 + 10 2 + 10 4 + • ■ • + 10 2 * or 
10“ +2 + 1 is divisible by 101. If k > 1, then whichever of these two 
numbers is divisible by 101, the quotient will exceed 1; hence 
1 + 10 4 + 10 8 + ■ • • + 10 4i is, for k > 1, expressible as the product 

of two (nontrivial) factors. If k = 1, we have the number 10 4 + 1 = 

10,001, which is a composite number (10,001 = 73-137). 

Remark'. It is possible to prove in a similar way that the following numbers 
are all composite:

(See problem 64. The last factor, 2 — 1, can be disregarded.) Thus, 
the integer 2 2 * — 1 = (2 2 * -hi) — 2 is divisible by all the numbers of 
the given sequence which it exceeds. It follows that if 2 2 * + 1 and 
2 2Jt -h 1, where k < n, have a common nontrivial divisor, then this 
common divisor must also divide 2, and hence must be 2. Since all 
the integers of the sequence are odd, it follows that there exists no 
common divisor for any two of them. 

66. The number 2 n is not divisible by 3. If 2* yields the remainder 
1 upon division by 3, then 2 n — 1 is divisible by 3; if 2 n yields the 
remainder 2 upon division by 3, then 2 n + 1 is divisible by 3. There¬ 
fore, in all cases one of the two numbers, 2 n — 1 or 2 n + 1, is divisi¬ 
ble by 3; hence, if both integers exceed 3, they cannot both be 
primes. 

67. (a) If a prime number p > 3 yields the remainder 2 when 
divided by 3, then Sp — 1 is divisible by 3. Hence, to meet the 
condition of the problem, p must yield the remainder 1 when divided 
by 3. But Sp + 1 is divisible by 3. If p = 3, then Sp + 1 = 25, which 
is composite. 

(b) If p is not divisible by 3, then p 2 yields the remainder 1 
when divided by 3 [see the solution of problem 53 (b)], and then 
Sp 2 + 1 is divisible by 3. Hence, the condition of the problem can 
be met only if p = 3. But then Sp 2 — 1 = 71 is a prime number. 

68. If p > 3 is a prime, it can yield only 1 or 5 as a remainder 
upon division by 6 (if p = 6k + 2, or p = 6& + 4, then it is an even 
number; if p — 6k + 3, then it is divisible by 3). Hence, the square 
of the prime p must have one of the two forms 36& 2 + 12w -f 1 or 
36n 2 -f 60 n + 25. Each of these integers yields the remainder 1 when 
divided by 12. 

69. As explained in the solution of problem 68, a prime number 
p > 3 must have one of the two forms 6n + 1 or 6n -f 5. Given three 
distinct primes, all exceeding 3, at least two of them must yield the 
same remainder upon division by 6. The difference between these 
two numbers, which is d or 2d, where d is the common difference 
of the arithmetic progression, is then divisible by 6, whence, neces¬ 
sarily, the common difference d is divisible by 3. But since d is the 
difference of two odd numbers, it is also divisible by 2. Therefore, 
in every case, d must be divisible by 6. [See also the solution of 
problem 70 (a).]

Solutions {70)

70. (a) Since all primes exceeding 2 are odd, the common differ¬ 
ence of the arithmetic progression sought must be an even number; 
hence, we may eliminate 2 as a possible term of the progression. 
Also, since there are certainly three successive terms of the pro¬ 
gression, all of which exceed 3 and which by themselves must form 
an arithmetic progression, the common difference d must be (ac¬ 
cording to problem 69) divisible by 6, that is, divisible by both 2 
and by 3. 

We now show that d must be divisible by 5. Assume d is not 
divisible by 5. Then the numbers 

a, a + d t a + 2d, a + 3d, a + 4d 

all yield different remainders upon division by 5 (if two of the re¬ 
mainders are equal, then it is easily shown that d is divisible by 5, 
a contradiction of the assumption just made). Thus, one of the 
numbers of the progression is then divisible by 5. Since all the 
term of the progression are prime, this is a contradiction. Hence 
d must be divisible by 5. We can show, in the same manner, that 
d must be divisible by 7. (This conclusion cannot be reached for 
11, since there are to be only ten terms in the progression, and 
a, a + d, ••■,« + 9d would not necessarily provide a number divisible 
by 11.) Therefore, the common difference d of the progression must 
be a multiple of 2-3-5-7 = 210; that is, d = 210#. 

According to the conditions of the problem, 

= a x + 9d = a x + 1890# < 3000 . 

This inequality is impossible for k ^ 2, hence, necessarily, k = 1. It 
follows that 

a, < 3000 - 9 d= 3000 - 1890 = 1110 . 

Now, 210 =11-19 + 1; consequently, the {m + l)st term of the pro¬ 
gression may be represented in the form 

a m+l ~ + (IT 19 + 1) • m = 11*19 m + (a t + m) . 

It follows that if a v yields a remainder of 2 upon division by 11, 
then a lQ is divisible by 11. If a x yields a remainder of 3 when divided 
by 11, then a* is divisible by 11, and so on. Therefore, a x cannot 
yield upon division by 11 any of the remainders 2, 3,4, ■*•, or 10. 
If a x + 11, then since a x is prime it cannot be divisible by 11; this 
means that either a x = 11 or a x yields a remainder of 1 upon division 
by 11, Further, since 210 =13*16 + 16 + 2, and so 


a m+l = a x + (13*16 + 2 )m = 13*16w + (a x + 2m) , 

it may be shown that if a x is divisible by 13, it can yield as a re¬ 
mainder only one of the numbers 2,4,6,8,10, or 12. Since a, is odd 
(as are all the terms of the progression), either a, = 11 or it can be 
written in one of the following forms: 

2-11-13/+ 23 = 286/+ 23 , 286/+ 155 , 

286/ + 45 , 286/ + 177 , 

286/ + 67 , 286/ + 199 , 

Since a x < 1110, the possible values for a x are limited to the integers 

11; 23, 309, 595, 881; 45, 331, 615,903; 67, 353, 637, 925; 

155, 441,727,1013; 177, 463, 749,1035; 199, 485, 771,1057 , 

of which the following are prime: 

11,23,881, 331,67, 353,727,1013,463,199 . 

We have found the necessary conditions for the existence of the 
progression sought; namely, d = 210, and a, equal to one of the prime 
numbers listed. We must test each of the possibilities (for example, 
a, = 11 is quickly found untenable, since then a 2 = 221 = 13-17, which 
is not prime). Exactly one of the above primes, a , = 199, will pro¬ 
duce an acceptable progression: 

199,409,619,829,1039,1249,1459,1669,1879, 2089 . 

(b) This problem is solved in a manner analogous to the 
solution of problem (a); however, the progression found there cannot 
be extended since the following term fails to be prime. 

If a x =£ 11, then, proceeding exactly as in problem (a), we find t a 
the common difference d of the progression sought must be a multi¬ 
ple of 2-3-5-7-11 = 2310 (d = 2310*). It follows that 
a„ = a, + 23 100* > 20,000 . 

Hence we need investigate only the case for which a, = 11. Here, 
we can have only d = 210*. Since 210 = 13-16 + 2, we can write for 
the general term of the desired progression 

a n+1 = 11 + (13-16 + 2 )kn = 13(16*« + 1) + 2 (kn - 1) . 

However, for any * = 1, 2, 3,4, 5,7,8,9, or 10, we can always find 
an 10 such that kn - 1 is divisible by 13, whence a n+l fails to 
be a prime number. (These values of n are, respectively, 1,7,9,10, 
8, 2, 5, 3, 4.) If k = 6 and d = 210*6 = 1260, then

155 


The Divisibility of Integers 

a 4 = 11 + 3 • 1260 = 3791 f 

which is divisible by 17. Therefore, if a L = 11, then necessarily 
k > 10, and so d ^ 2100, but then a lQ > 20,000. 

71. (a) If the difference of two odd numbers does not exceed 4, 
then they cannot have a common divisor which exceeds 4. Thus, 
two of the five consecutive numbers can either have at most a 
common divisor of 2, 3, or 4 or be relatively prime. At least two 
of the five consecutive numbers must be odd, and of two consecutive 
odd numbers at least one will fail to be divisible by 3. Hence there 
is at least one odd number among the five consecutive integers which 
fails to be divisible by 3. This integer will necessarily be relatively 
prime to the remaining four integers. 

(b) The reasoning employed here closely resembles that used 
in problem (a), but it is much more involved. If the difference of 
two odd numbers does not exceed /e, then they cannot have a common 
divisor which exceeds k. To determine whether two integers are 
relatively prime, it suffices to consider only prime factors; hence it 
suffices to show that, given sixteen consecutive integers, it is always 
possible to find one of them which fails to have in common with 
any one of the other integers a divisor of 2,3,5,7,11, or 13. That 
integer will be relatively prime to all the others. 

First we discard the even numbers of the sixteen successive inte¬ 
gers. There remain eight consecutive odd numbers. Divisibility 
by 3 clearly holds for either 

(1) the first, fourth, and seventh of these eight numbers, 

(2) for the second, fifth, and eighth numbers, or 

(3) for the third and sixth numbers. 

Divisibility by 5 holds for either the first and sixth, or for the second 
and seventh, or for the third and eighth, or for one number only 
(the fourth or the fifth). Divisibility by 7 holds either for the first 
and eighth or for only one of the other integers. One, and only 
one, of the odd numbers can be divisible by 11, and only one by 13. 

If not more than five of the eight consective odd numbers are 
divisible by one of the primes 3, 5, or 7, then there must exist among 
the remaining three (or more) odd numbers at least one which is 
divisible neither by 11 nor by 13. Since that number will fail to 
have 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13 as a factor, it will be relatively prime to all 
the other integers of the original sequence of sixteen numbers. 

We now consider the case in which the number of odd integers 
divisible by 3, 5, or 7 does not exceed six (which is the maximal 


Solutions (71) 

number of odd integers of the sequence which can be so divisible). 
We first assume that three of the eight odd numbers are divisible 
by 3. Then, depending upon which three numbers these are (first 
and fourth and seventh, or second and fifth and eighth), two re¬ 
maining numbers can be divisible by 5 (third and eighth, or first 
and sixth), and one of the remaining numbers might be divisible 
by 7. 

If we strike out the (at most) five numbers divisible by 3 or by 
5, there will remain either the second and fifth and sixth or the 
third and fourth and seventh of the eight odd numbers. We consider 
the first case. The second, fifth and sixth odd numbers stand either 
in the fourth, tenth, and twelfth positions of the original sequence 
of sixteen numbers or in the third ninth and eleventh positions of 
that sequence. In the first-named positioning two of these odd 
numbers must fail to have 7 as a divisor; and, of these two, neither 
can have a common divisor of 13 with any other number of the 
original sequence, since both differ from all the other numbers by 
less than 13. Since at most one of these two numbers is divisible 
by 11, at least one remains which cannot be divisible by 2,3,5,7,11, 
or 13 and so must be relatively prime to all the other numbers of 
the original sequence. In the second-named positioning (third, ninth, 
and eleventh), if one of these odd numbers has the factor 13 in 
common with another number of the original sequence of sixteen 
consecutive numbers, it can be only that number standing in the 
third position. If we throw out that number, we are left with num¬ 
bers in the ninth and eleventh positions. Only one of these two 
numbers can be divisible by 7; whichever it is, the remaining one 
cannot have a factor of 11 in common with any other number of 
the original sequence, since it differs from all of them by a number 
less than 11. Hence at least one number will be relatively prime to 
all the others of the original sequence. The argument for the case 
in which the third, fourth, and seventh numbers of the sequence of 
odd integers remain after those divisible by 3 or by 5 are thrown 
out is quite analogous, and is left for the reader. 

If only two numbers of the sequence of eight odd numbers are 
divisible by 3 (the third and sixth), then it is possible for two of 
the remaining numbers (the first and eighth) to be divisible by 7, 
and two more can be divisible by 5 (the second and seventh). If 
these six numbers are struck out, only the fourth and fifth of the 
eight odd numbers are retained, and these two are not divisible by 
3, 5, or 7. Each of these remaining two numbers will be relatively

The Divisibility of Integers 


prime to the other fifteen numbers of the original sequence, since 
each of them will differ from the remaining fifteen numbers by less 
than 11, and hence could not share with any of them a common 
divisor of 11 or 13. This completes the proof. 

Remark: The proposition may be proved for any sequence of successive 
integers fewer than sixteen (say, ten or twelve) by techniques similar to that 
used above. The proposition does not hold for a sequence of seventeen num¬ 
bers.' Whether such a proposition is true for k> 17 numbers, or for special 
numbers le, is not known, 

72. Since 6 = 3-2, the product in question will be the same as 
that obtained by multiplying the integer A t consisting of 666 digits 
9 by the integer B l composed of 666 digits 2. But A, is 1 less than 
10"' (the di § it 1 with 666 2er os following); and so if is multiplied 
by A ,, the result is the same as multiplying B, by 10 666 (which 
yields an integer composed of 666 digits 2 followed by 666 zeros) 
and subtracting the integer B t . It clearly follows that the result 
will be a number of form

Moreover, the number 77,777 yields a quotient of 77 and a re-

(the fifth digit of the result is 0, since x x can be only 4 or 5, and 
analogous reasoning shows that the sixth digit, if it is to terminate 
the square root and produce a least number, will be 5). 

The remainder now vanishes if a 9 = 4, a 10 = 0, a n = 2, a l2 = 5 and 
Xi = 4, x 2 = 7, * 3 = 1; it is easily deduced that a s = 6 4- 1 = 7 and 
a 7 = (7 + 9) — 10 = 6. Hence the smallest integer with an even num¬

222,222,674,025 = 471,405 2 .

Since the number formed by the digits x u x 2 is not less than 33 
( = 119 — 86) and does not exceed 43 ( = 129 — 86), it follows that the 
sixth digit of the root is 1. Hence the extraction of the root does 
not end here, but continues. Consequently, the smallest number 
having an odd number of digits, and satisfying the conditions of the 
problem, is not less than the twelve-digit number 222,222,674,025. 
Therefore, this is the number sought.

75. If the positive number a is less than 1, then Va is less than 
1. Assume that the decimal representation of Va mentioned in the 
problemhas fewer than 100 digits 9 at its beginning. This implies 

that V a< 1 — ("io/ • If we square both sides of this inequality,

But 1 2 ( io ) + (if) < 1 “ (if) , 0 ° : therefore *« < i - 

which means that the decimal representing a. cannot begin with 100 
digits 9. This contradiction proves the proposition of the problem. 

76. The desired number commencing with the digits 523 and 
divisible by 7-8-9 = 504 can be written in the form 523,000 + X, 
where A" is a three-digit number. Ordinary division yields 523,000 = 
504-1037 + 352; that is, 523,000 yields a remainder of 352 when di¬ 
vided by 504. Since the sum of 523,000 and the three-digit number 
x must be divisible by 504, it follows that X can be equal to 

504 - 352 = 152 , 

or to 

2-504 - 352 = 656 

(the number 3-504 -352 has four digits). Hence the two numbers 
523,152 and 523,656 satisfy the conditions of the problem. 

77. Let N be the desired four-digit number. The conditions of 
the problem gives 

N= 131£ + 112 = 132/ + 98 , 

where k and / are positive integers. Since W is a four-digit number 
it is clear that

It is evident that if k - l is not zero, then / — 14 exceeds 130 in

[(10” - 1) + lO^l-O-lO”- 1 
2 

This number is equal to the sum of the arithmetic progression 
having common difference 1 and having lO^ 1 as its first term and 
10* — 1 as its last term (the number of terms of this progression is 
equal to 10 n — lO 7 ^ 1 = 9-XO 7 ^ 1 ), which is the sum of all the ?z-digit 
integers. 

(b) The number of integers (in the sum) which have a given 
digit a as first digit (a may be 1,2, 3, 4, or 5) is 6-6*3 = 108 (since 
any of the six digits 0,1,2, 3, 4, 5 may stand in the second or in the 
third position, and any one of the three digits 0, 2, 4 may terminate 
the even integer). Consider the contribution made to the sum by 
the thousands column: when the digit 1 stands here the sum is 
1*108*1000; when the digit 2 stands here, the contribution of this 
column to the sum is 2*108-1000; and so on. Thus, the contribution 
made by the thousands column to the sum is the total 

(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)-108-1000 - 1,620,000 . 

Now we consider, in analogous fashion, the contribution to the 
sum made by the hundreds place of the numbers. For any digit b 
in this (second) position there are 5-6-3 — 90 possible numbers in the 
other positions. This column contributes to the sum the total 

(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)-90-100 = 135,000 . 

(We need not consider here the numbers in which the digit 0 stands 



160 


Some Problems in Arithmetic 


in the hundreds position; they contribute 0*90*100 = 0 to the total 
for this column.) 

In a similar manner we find that the sum contributed by the tens 
column is (1 4- 2 4- 3 4- 4 + 5) *90 *10 = 13,500; and the sum contributed 
by the units column is (2 4- 4)*5*6*6 = 1080. Therefore, the sum 
sought is equal to 

1,620,000 4- 135,000 4- 13,500 4- 1080 = 1,769,580 . 

79. We first investigate the integers from 0 to 99,999,999. In so 
doing we “fill in” with zeros at the beginning, all integers having 
fewer than eight digits so that these integers have the format of 
eight-digit numbers. We then have 100,000,000 eight-digit “numbers.” 
To write all of these, we shall need a stockpile containing 800,000,000 
digits. Now, if we write 00,000,000 at the top of a sheet and 
99,999,999 at the bottom and, moving from the top down and from 
the bottom up, fill in the successive numbers (always filling in with 
zeros where necessary), we readily see that each digit (including 
zero) will be used exactly the same number of times. That is, if 
the stockpile of 800,000,000 digits is partitioned into ten bins, each 
labeled for a different digit, then each bin will contain 80,000,000 
digits all of the same kind. 

Now we calculate how many zeros we have used to fill out inte¬ 
gers containing fewer than eight meaningful digits. There are nine 
one-digit numbers (omitting zero), 99 — 9 = 90 two-digit numbers, 
999 — 99 = 900 three digit-numbers, and so on. To fill out the one¬ 
digit numbers, we used seven zeros; to fill out the two-digit numbers, 
we needed six zeros; and so on. Hence the total number of extrane¬ 
ous zeros required for filling out the numbers (disregarding the zeros 
used for the first “number,” 00,000,000) is given by the series 

7*9 4- 6*90 4- 5*900 4- 4*9000 4- 3*90,000 

4- 2*900*000 4- 1*9,000,000 = 11,111,103 . 

We now append the digit 1 to the first number 00,000,000, thus 
obtaining all the integers from 1 to 100,000,000. In order to write 
all these numbers we need 80,000,000 twos and the same number of 
threes, fours, and so on up to and including nines; we also need 
80,000,001 digits 1 and 80,000,000 - 11,111,103 = 68,888,897 zeros. 

80. In all, there are nine one-digit numbers, 99 — 9 = 90 two-digit 
numbers, 999 — 99 = 900 three-digit numbers; and, in general, there 
are 9-10* w-digit numbers.

One-digit numbers occupy nine positions in the sequential 
written in the problem. Two-digit numbers occupy the next^ ■ 

180 positions; three-digit numbers occupy the next 900-3 - 2700 posi 
tions° S four-digit numbers occupy the next 9000-4 = 36,000 portion.; 
Z Jive-digH number* occupy the next 90,000 5 = 450,000 posmone. 

It is clear that the digit of interest to us appears in one of the ft 
digit numbers, since we have filled only 38,889 positions before 
starting to write five-digit numbers, and when we have appended 
the five-dight numbers we will have filled 488,889 places. 

To find out how many five-digit numbers are in the interval from 
the 38,889th to the 206,788th position, we divide the difference 
206,788 - 38,889 = 167,889 by 5: 

206,788 - 38,889 = 5-33,579 + 4 . 

Thus, the digit sought must belong to the 33,580th five-digit number 
that is. to the number 33,579 (since the live digit numbers began with 
10,000). The digit sought is the fourth digit of this number. 7. 

81. Assume that the decimal 0-1234 - -■ is periodic, that n is the 
periodicity (number of digits in a period), and that k is the number 
of digits encountered before the periodic position starts. Consider 
the integer 10" (the digit 1 followed by m zeros), where m is not 
less than n + k. In composing the decimal we wrote in succession 
all the integers; hence any chosen number N will appear somewhere 
(it will surely appear when we append the nth integer) Since in 
the 'sequence of numbers written in to make up the infinite decimal 
m>n + k zeros must be encountered, it follows that the on y pos 
sible period consists of one zero-a situation which does not hold 
for this decimal. Hence the decimal is not periodic. 

82. Let us take nine weights weighing n\ (n + D 2 . (» + 2 ) 2 - 
(„ + 8) 2 units (for a suitable n) and group them in three sets as 

follows: 

Set I: « 2 , (n + 5) 2 , (n + 7) 2 . 

Then, m 2 + (n + 5) 2 + (n + 7)* = 3m 2 + 24m + 74. 

Set II: (n + l) 2 , (* + 3) 2 , (n + 8) 2 . 

Then, (» + l) 2 + (« + 3) 2 + (» + 8) 2 - 3m 2 + 24m + 74. 

Set III: (n + 2) 2 , (m + 4) 2 , (m + 6) 2 . 

Then, (m + 2) 2 + (n + 4) 2 + (« + 6) 2 = 3n 2 + 24m + 56. 

For any allowable n the total weights of the first and second sets 



162 


Some Problems in Arithmetic 


are equal, and the total weight of the third set is lighter by 18 units. 

If we do this for n = 1, we will have taken the first nine weights 
and grouped them as follows: Set I: 1,6,8; Set II: 2,4,9; Set III: 
3, 5, 7. The first two sets are equal in weight, and the third is 18 
units lighter. We now do this for n — 10 (thus choosing the next 
nine weights), but after the groupings we interchange the second 
and third sets, which means that the second set is 18 units lighter 
than the other two sets. We do this for the third set of nine weights 
(n = 19), and after grouping as for the first trial we interchange the 
first and third sets, whence the first set is 18 units lighter than 
the other two sets. It is now clear how the three final groupings 
may be made. 

83. Draw a ray from the pin through one of the vertices of the 

polygon. If this ray turns through 25£°, then it must contain another 
vertex of the polygon. Now, 25^° is 17/240 of the circumference. 
Since 17 and 240 are relatively prime, if the ray is turned through 
an angle of 25^ any number of times up to 239 times, it will 
not duplicate a prior position. If the ray is turned through this 
angle m times, it turns through 17m/240 circumferences. In order 
for the &th and /th turns of the ray to fall on a prior position, 
17&/240 circumferences must differ from 17//240 circumferences by 
an integral number; that is, ■- must be an integer. There¬ 

fore, k — l must be divisible by 240. It follows that either k — l or 
k ^ 240. Counting in the initial position we obtain 240 different rays. 
One vertex lies on each of these rays, and hence there can be no 
fewer than 240 vertices. On the other hand, the 240-sided polygon, 
upon rotation through 17/240 of a circumference, coincides with its 
initial position. Hence the least number of sides which the polygon 
can have is 240. 

84. (a) The first digit of each of the three-digit numbers must 
be the smallest possible one; hence we may assume that the three 
numbers have the form 

lAa, 2Bb , 3 Cc , 

where the overbar indicates a succession of digits; for example, 
2 Bb = 2-10 2 + B -10 + b. 

We shall show that necessarily: A < B < C; a < b < c\ each of the 
digits a , b , and c is greater than any of the digits A, B , and C. 

(1) Assume A > B. Then Aa > Bb , and so

which would mean that 

\Bb-2Aa-3Cc < LAa ■ 2Bb-3Cc , 

whence the product on the right would not be the least as required. 
The assumption B > C will produce a similar contradiction. 

(2) Assume a > b. Then 

TAa-Wb - LAb-Wa _ __ 

= (10-12 + «X10-2B + b) - (10-1 A + M10-2 B + a) 

= (10-25 - 10-L4)(« - b) > 0 , 

which would mean that 

lAb'2Ba'3Cc < lAa-2Bb-3Cc , 

which again is a contradiction. The result b < c is similarly shown 
(3) Assume C > a, or C = a + x, where * > 0. According to the 
first demonstration C is the largest of the digits A, B, C; and according 
to the second demonstration « is the smallest of the digits a, b, c. In 
this case we would have 

~\Aa-3Cc - TAC-3ac = LAa-(3ac + 10*) - d Aa + *)(3 ac) 

= *(10- L Aa - 3 ac) > 0 , 

which yields the contradiction 

\AC-2Bb-3ac < TAa-2Bb-3Cc . 

It follows from (1), (2), and (3) that 

A<B<C<a<b<c, 

whence the product sought is composed as follows: 

147-258-369 . 

(b) It is clear that the largest digits must be the initial digits of 
each number; hence we may write the product in the form 

9Aa-8Bb-7Cc . 

Employing techniques analogous to those used in problem (a) we

cancelled. (If only the final term of the progression were to remain, 
we could set up the equation 2 k + / = TV = 2 k (2l 4- 1), which would 
imply that k — —1.) 

Assume now that some number of form 2 k can be written as the 
sum of m consecutive positive integers w, w -h 1, w -f- w -2, 
n + m — 1. Then 

2 *+i = 2[« + (w + 1) + ■ ■ ■ + (n + m — 2) + (n + m — 1)] 

= m (n + n + m — 1) = m(2n 4- m — 1) . 

But the difference (2n + m — 1) — m = 2n — 1 is an odd number, and, 
consequently, one of the numbers, m or 2n 4- m — 1, must be odd 
(and both differ from 1 since, by hypothesis, m > 1 and n > 0). This 
means that the equality derived above, 2 k+l = m(2n 4- m — 1), is im¬ 
possible since 2 k+l cannot have an odd divisor other than 1. 

(b) We have, for any m > n 4-1, 


(2n 4 ~ 1 ) 4 ~ ( 2 n 4 " 3 ) 4 - ( 2 n 4 ~ 5 ) 4 - ■ • * 4 ~ ( 2 tn — 1 )

• (m — n) = (m 4 - n) ■ (m — n) . 


[If m = n4-l, then there is only one term; there are (m — n) terms.] 
Hence if a number N can be written as the sum of consecutive odd 
numbers, then it is a composite number (the product of numbers 
m 4- n and m — n). Now, any composite odd number N can be 
written as the product of two odd factors a and b y (a > 1), and 
so we can write 

TV = a b = (m 4- n)(m — n) , 

where we set m = and n = - . (Note that for b > 1, 

m > n 4-1). Hence, N = (m 4- ri)(m — n) is the sum of a sequence 
of consecutive odd numbers, the odd numbers from a — b 4-1 to 
a + b — 1. Clearly, no prime number can be represented in this 
form, since then the prime would be the product (m 4- n)(m — n) r 
whence m — n = 1, and so the series reduces to one term, the prime 
number itself. This proves the first assertion. 

Now, in the formula TV= (m 4- n\m — «), the factors m 4- n and 
m — n are either both even or else both are odd (their difference is 
even). Hence if TV is an even integer, both of these factors must 
be even. In this case TV is divisible by 4; therefore, an even number 
TV which fails to be divisible by 4 cannot be written as a sum of 
consecutive odd numbers. On the other hand, if TV = 4«, then TV can

87. Designate the four consecutive integers by n, n + 1, n + 2, 
n + 3. If 1 is added to their product, we have 

n(n + 1 )(n + 2)(« + 3) + 1 

= [«(« + 3)]((w + 1X« + 2)] + 1 = (n 2 + 3 n)(n 2 + 3n + 2) + 1 
= ( n 2 + 3 n) 1 + 2 (n 2 + 3 n) + 1 = (n 2 + 3n + l) 2 . 

Therefore, the product of the four numbers is one less than the 
square of the integer n 2 + 3« + 1. 

88. We shall show that the set of integers can contain only four 
different values. Assume the contrary—that among the 4 it integers 
there are five of them, a lt a 2 , a 3 , a 3 , a 5 , all distinct. Let us agree that 
a i < a 2 < a 3 < a x < a 5t 

Consider the integers a u a 2 ,a 3 ,a t . Under the conditions of the 
problem it is possible to form a proportion out of these integers 
Hence the product of the extremes will be equal to the product of 
the means. This is feasible only if 

d\d\ — d<id% 

(the equation d { a 3 = a 2 d K is impossible, since d t < a 2 and < 2 3 < a A ; it 
is clear also that a Y a 2 = a$d K is impossible). 

Now consider the integers * 2 , * a , *s. Again, if a proportion is 
to be formed, the only possibility is a.o, = a 2 d 3t Consequently, we 
must have d v d A — a x a u which is a contradiction, since a 4 * a h . 
Therefore, the set of 4 n numbers cannot contain more than four 
distinct integers, and so at least one of the integers must appear n 
times. 

89. We note, first, that the difference of two positive integers is 
odd if, and only if, one of the integers is odd and the other even; 
we obtain an even difference only from two even or two odd integers. 


Let us designate an even number by the letter e, and an odd number 
by the letter o. For four arbitrary integers A, B , C\ and Z>, we have 
the following “essentially different” possible even-odd combinations 
and arrangements; 


(1) e, e,e, e; 

(4) e,o,e,o 

(2) e, e, e, o ; 

(5) e, 0 , 0,0 

(3) e,e,o,o. 

(6) 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 


All other arrangements can be obtained by “cyclic permutation” of 
these six arrangements (that is, by moving an arrangement to the 
right, and putting the fourth integer in the first place, and so on, 
not changing the order of appearance). We shall show that, in every 
case, after not more than four steps (as described in the problem) 
we must arrive at four even numbers. First, combination (1) already 
consists of four even numbers; combination (6) achieves the desired 
effect in the first step; combination (4) becomes combination (6) in 
one step, so it arrives in the desired form in two steps; combination 
(3) becomes combination (4) in one step, so it becomes combination 
(1) in three steps; finally, combinations (2) and (5) become, in one 
step, combination (3) [for combination (5) we first employ cyclic 
permutation], so in four steps we achieve the sought combination 
(1). Thus, in every case, we arrive at a quadruple of four even 
numbers in at most four steps. 

We continue the process of forming new quadruples of numbers, and 
now we are working entirely with even integers. It is readily 
reasoned that after at most four more steps, we obtain numbers 
divisible by 4 (if some of the even numbers are not already divisible 
by 4, we divide all numbers by 2, and in four steps we have numbers 
divisible again by 2); in at most four more steps we obtain integers 
divisible by 8, and so on. If the process is continued long enough, 
we must be able to arrive at a quadruple of numbers divisible by 
any desired power of 2. Since the numbers we obtain are decreasing 
in absolute value, we must arrive at a point where we have at least 
one zero, and finally at a point where we have four zeros (this will 
occur in at most 4* steps, albeit we will usually arrive at this point 
much earlier). 

Remark : The analogous theorem may be proved for any number 2 k of posi¬ 
tive integers. For n numbers, where n is not a power of 2, the proof does 
not carry through. For example, if the members are 1,1,0, we never do 
arrive at the triple 0, 0, 0. We have:

We note, further, that the numbers A , B, C, and D can be rational numbers—

in the following order, the condition of the problem is satisfied.

(b) From whatever arrangement of the 101 integers has 
been presented we select the first integer, labeling it a[ u ; then (always 
moving left to right) we select the next integer al" which follows 
and exceeds a\ l) t and so on. This produces an increasing sequence 
a[ l) t ai l) r (which may conceivably end at the first integer). If 

more than ten numbers appear in this sequence (i > 10), the problem 
is solved. If, however, i < 10, we cross out the integers already 
used, and from the remaining 101 — / integers we begin the con¬ 
struction of a new sequence, following the same procedure. We 
then obtain a new increasing sequence a [ r> , , ■ ■ •, alf . Continu¬ 

ation of this process creates from the ordered set of 101 integers a 
number of increasing sequences. If any one of them contains more 
than ten integers, the problem has heen solved. Hence we need 
consider only the case in which none of the sequence we have made 
up contains more than ten integers. 

Since there are 101 integers in all, the number k of increasing 
sequences must in this case be at least equal to 11. But then it is 
possible to select from the 101 integers a decreasing sequence of 
eleven integers. A procedure for doing this follows. 

We select as the final element of the sequence to be constructed 
the final element of the final sequence af k . Then if we select from 
the previous sequence that number among those of the original 


Solutions (90-91) 

sequence not yet crossed out, which just precedes a\ k , that number 
will exceed ; otherwise would have appeared in the preceding 
sequence. This selected number a?~ l) is placed to the left of a\^ in 
the new sequence. Now we work with a ,■ . In the sequence just 

preceding the (k - l)st, the element which had appeared just before 
a?' 1 ' (among those not already crossed out in the original sequence) 
will exceed a/'". This number is placed to the left a?' 1 ' in the 
new sequence being formed. We can continue in this manner, 
selecting larger and larger numbers, each appearing earlier in the 
initial array of 101 numbers, and it is clear that we can make at 
least eleven such selections. 

Remark-. It can be proved in analogous way that in — l) 2 positive integers 
can be arranged in such an order that no n of them will follow sequentially 
in either an increasing or a decreasing order, but that among k > (n — l) 2 
integers a sequence of n increasing, or decreasing, numbers can be selected 
sequentially from the initial array. 

91. (a) Reduce each of the 101 selected numbers by the greatest 
power of 2 which divides it, thus obtaining 101 odd numbers. Since 
there are precisely 100 distinct odd numbers from 1 to 200, at least 
two of the 101 odd numbers must be identical. This means that 
among the 101 numbers originally selected there exist two whose 
factorizations differ only by a power of 2. The smaller of these two 
numbers must divide the other. 

Remark: A proof by mathematical induction is also possible. 

(b) The desired numbers can be selected in the following 
manner: The fifty odd numbers from 101 to 199; the odd numbers 
from 51 to 99, each multiplied by 2 (twenty-five numbers); the odd 
numbers from 27 to 49, each multiplied by 4 (twelve numbers); the 
odd numbers from 13 to 25, each multiplied by 8 (seven numbers); 
the odd numbers from 7 to 11, each multiplied by 16 (three numbers); 
and finally, the three numbers 3-32,5-32, and 1-64. These total 100 
numbers, all less than 200, and none of which is divisible by any 
other. 

(c) Assume that it is possible to select 100 integers, none 
exceeding 200, such that no one of them is divisible by any other. 
We shall show that none of the numbers 1-15 inclusive can appear 
in the selected set. 

As in the solution of problem (a), we divided out of each number 
the largest power of 2 which appears as a factor. We obtain a 





170 


Some Problems in Arithmetic 


second set consisting of 100 odd numbers, none exceeding 200. No 
two of these odd numbers belonging to the second set can be equal 
(otherwise the corresponding original numbers would differ from 
each other only by a factor which is a power of 2, and so one would 
be divisible by the other). Accordingly, the 100 odd numbers of the 
second set are 1, 3, 5, * *, 199. 

Since 15 divides 45, the integer 2*-15 of the initial set must have 
ol > 0, since otherwise 15 would divide 45*2^, which also appears in 
the initial set. This means that 15 cannot have appeared in the 
initial set. The same line of reasoning eliminates the possibility 
that 13,11, or 9 appeared in the initial set. We now consider the 
integer 7. It is clear that 7-2®, which is a number of the initial 
set, must have a ^ 1. But suppose that a = 1. Since 7 divides 49, 
which in turn divides 147, and since both 49-2^ and 147*2 V belong to 
the initial set, it is clear that 0 = r is impossible, hence not both *3 
and r can be zero. But r is certainly zero, since the initial set 
centains no integer exceeding 200. Therefore, 7-2 must divide 49*2^; 
this eliminates both 7 and 14 from appearance in the initial set. The 
same line of reasoning shows that the integers 5, 10, 3, 6, and 12 
cannot belong to the initial set. The integer 1 is automatically 
rejected, by hypothesis, and the integer 2 is rejected, since its in¬ 
clusion would give precisely the set of 100 odd numbers between 1 
and 200, a set which clearly fails to meet the conditions of the 
problem. 

There remain for consideration only the integers 4 and 8. Were 
4 to belong to the initial set, then 2® could not be a factor of any 

other member of the initial set unless a ^ 1. But this is impossible, 

since it would eliminate the appearance of the integer 3 from the 
second set (neither 3 nor 6, as has been shown, can belong to the 
initial set). By similar reasoning the integer 8 is shown to be im¬ 
possible of inclusion in the initial set. Therefore, none of the inte¬ 
gers from 1 to 15, inclusive, can appear in the initially selected set. 

Remark : It can proved, in general, that out of the first 2 n (or fewer) inte¬ 
gers it is impossible to select (n + 1) integers having the property that no one 
of them is divisible by another, but that it is possible to select n (or fewer) 
such integers. If 3* < 2 n < 3 t + I , then out of the first 2 n integers it is im¬ 
possible to select n integers, one of them less than 2 k , such that no number 
is divisible by another. But n such numbers can be selected, provided the 
least is equal to 2 k . For example, from 200 numbers it is possible to select 

100, the least equal to 16, not one of which is divisible by another.

obtain a negative remainder; a - 100? - r, where now 0 < r < 50 
Since (counting zero) there exist 51 possible distinct rernamders o

remainders obtained upon dividing 52 numbers by 100 attej two 
of these remainders are equal in absolute value If these‘w<> re

If N is relatively prime to 10, then 1 IN yields a decimal which is

95. We shall consider only the final four digits of the integers of 
the Fibonacci sequence wherever these integers contain five or more 
digits; that is, we shall deal with a sequence of integers all less 
than 10 4 . Let a k designate the (four-digit) number appearing in the 
&th place of this sequence (that is, the final four digits of the &th 
term of the Fibonacci sequence). If we know the integers a k + 1 
and a k , we can easily find a k - 1 , since the four digits composing a k ~i 
will depend only on the corresponding four digits of a k+l and a k . 
Now, if for two natural numbers k and n we find that a k — a n+k and 
a k +i = a*+ k +i, then it will follow that 

d k \. = ^arJi- l > 

O-k—2 — dn+k—it 


d\ — #» +1 

(since any number of a Fibonacci sequence is the positive difference 
between the two succeeding numbers). However, since at = 0, it 
must then follow that d n+l = 0; an integer terminating in four zeros 
will stand in the (n + l)st place of the Fibonacci sequence.

It will suffice to show, then, that there exists an identical pair 
among the 10 8 + 1 pairs:

But this certainly must occur in the set of numbers a u a 2 , a 2t ■ • •, 
a i(i 8 + 2 , since none of them exceeds 10 \ and from the 10 4 integers 
0,1, 2, 3, 4, • • ■, 999 we can obtain only 10 4 *10 4 = 10 8 distinct pairs 
(the first number can assume at most 10 4 distinct values, and the 
second number can take on only 10 4 distinct values). 

Remark : It can be shown that the first integer of this Fibonacci sequence 
which will end in four zeros stands in the 7501st place (see the book by B. B. 
Dynkin and V. A. Uspensky, Mathematical Conversations, Issue 6, Library of 
the USSR Mathematical Society, especially problem 174 and the discussion of 
it). 

96. Consider the decimal parts of the 1001 numbers: 

0-# = 0, a, 2 a> 3a, * ■ •, lOOOar 

(the difference between the given number and the largest number 
not exceeding the given number). This yields 1001 positive numbers, 
is decimal form, all less than 1. Partition the interval between 0 
and 1 on the real-number axis into 1000 intervals (we shall assume 
that each interval contains its left end point but not its right end 
point). We shall investigate how the points of the above sequence 
are distributed among these intervals of length 1 / 1000 . Since there 
are 1000 intervals and 1001 points, at least one of the intervals must 
contain two (or more) points. This shows that there exist two dis¬ 
tinct natural numbers, say p and q (neither exceeding 1000 ) such that 
the difference between the numbers pa and qa is less than 1 / 1000 . 

Say that p > q. Consider the number (p — q)a = pa — qa. Since 
pa = P + dy qa = Q + d 2r where P and Q are integers, and d t and 
d 2 are decimals pa and qa , it follows that (p — q)a = ( P—Q ) + d 2 — d v 
differs from the integer P—Q by less than 1 / 1000 . This implies 

that the fraction ——— differs from a by less than 0.001 (—-—Y 
p-q \p — q) 

97. First, it is readily seen that none of the fractions under con-

sideration is an integer. Further, no two of these fractions can be 
equal, for if, say, 

k(m + n) ___ l(m + n) 


(where k is one of the numbers 1, 2, ■ ■ *, m - 1, and / is one of the 
integers 1, 2, • • ■, n - 1), we would have 


which contradicts the fact that m and n are relatively prime (inas¬ 
much as l < n and so cannot be divisible by n). 

Consider now a natural number A less than m + n. The fractions 


m + n 2 (m + n) 


k(m + n) 


will be less than A, or k(m + n) is less than Am, if k is less than 

^ in . Clearly, the number of such fractions is equal to the inte- 
m + n ' ' 

gral part \ -1 of the fractions—. Similarly, the fractions

m + n 2 (m + n) 


l(m + n)

The number of such fractions 


is equal to the greatest integer 


MM i

The numbers and —are nonintegral, since m, n, and 

m + n are pairwise relatively prime, and the sum of these two 
numbers is A: 

Am An _ A 

m + n + m + n 

But if the sum of two numbers a and (9, neither an integer, is equal 
to an integer A, then [a] + [0] = A - 1. (The proof of this follows 
immediately from Figure 7.) Thus,

Some Problems in Arithmetic 


which implies that in the interval (0, A) on the real-number axis 
there exist precisely A — 1 of the fractions. 


Figure 7 

The proposition of the problem follows immediately. Let us first 
assume that A = 1; we see that none of the fractions is in the 
interval (0,1). Let A = 2; since there is one fraction in the interval 
(0, 2), it follows that this fraction must be in the interval (1, 2). Let 
>1=3; since the interval (0, 3) contains two of the fractions, it follows 
that the interval (2, 3) contains just one of them. Continuation of 
this reasoning completes the proof of the proposition. 

98. First Solution. If a number a is in the interval 


then there are obviously, m integral multiples of a which do not 
exceed 1000: a , 2a, 3a, * ■ ■, ma . Now, if we designate by k t the 

1000 

number of given integers which lie between 1000 and —-—, by k t 
the number which lie in the interval by h the number 

which lie in the interval and so on » then we have, in 

all, k x + 2kz + 3k, + • • * numbers, not exceeding 1000, which are 
multiples of at least one of the given numbers. But, according to 
the conditions of the problem, all these multiples are different, and so 

k\ + Ih + 3k, + • • * < 1000 . 

It remains to be shown that the sum of the reciprocals of all the 
given integers is less than 


k ' 1000 + ki 1000 + kl 1000 +

= (k x + 2k% + 3£ a + • • ■) + n < 1000 + n < 2000 ; 

consequently, the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers is less 
than 2. 

Second Solution. We introduce an important variation of the fore¬ 
going type of reasoning. The number of terms of the sequence 
1,2, •••,1000 which are divisible by an integer a* is obviously the 

greatest integer [®] in Since the least common multiple 

of any two of the integers a u a 2 , ■• •,«» exceeds 1000, not one of the 
numbers 1, 2, 3, • • •, 1000 can be divisible by two of the integers 

•••,«». It follows that the number of terms of the sequence 

1,2,3, •••,1000 which are divisible by at least one of the integers 
a u a u ■•■ t a n is equal to the sum 


Since the least common multiple 


Since there are 1000 numbers in the sequence 1,2, '*-,1000, it is

Remarks : The estimation of this bound can be made very precise. Consider 
all the multiples of those given integers which do not exceed 500. Now, k\ of 
the given integers will exceed 500; kz + ki of the integers will not exceed 500, 
but will exceed —; k* + Acs of them will not exceed —r—, but will exceed 


——; and so on. It follows, as in the first solution, that the total number of 
integers not exceeding 500, and which are multiples of at least one of the given 
n numbers, is equal to 

{ki -H ki) + 2(ki + ki) + 3 (k% + fo) + ■ ■ * , 

Therefore, 

(kz + ki) + 2(ki + ki) + 3 (ks + ky) + * ■ ■ < 500 . 

We note now that the difference 

500 — [(ki -t- ki) -t- 2{ki + ki) + •*•] 

expresses the number of integers, not exceeding 500, which are not multiples 
of any one of the given integers; and the difference 
1000 - (hi + 2ki + 3*3 + •■■) 

is the number of integers not exceeding 1000 which fail to be multiples of any 
one of the given integers. Consequently, 

500 — \(kz + ki) + 2 (ki + ki) + 3 (ks + ky) 4- ■ • ■] < 1000 — (ki + 2kz + 3ki + • * ■)>

Here, A is the whole part of the quotient obtained upon division of

where the remainder q , is less than p. Moreover, ~Aa, will be_the 
whole part of the quotient obtained upon division of 10? by p (Aa,

The periodic part of the decimal begins again at the point where 
division of 10*? by p yields the remainder first obtained, q k = Qu upon 
division of q by p. Thus, the number k of digits composing a period 
of the decimal is determined as the least power of 10 such that 10* •? 
yields on division by p the same remainder as did q. For this k 
it is clear that 10*? - ? = (10* - D? is divisible by p whence 10*-1 is 
divisible by p, inasmuch as p and ? are relatively prime (p itself is 

Assume now that k is even: k = 21. Since 10 21 — 1 — 0-0 — 1) x 
(10* + 1) is divisible by p, either 10‘ — 1 or 10 1 + 1 is divisible by the 
prime p. But 10' — 1 cannot be divisible by p, since if it were, it 
would yield the same remainder as does ? upon division by p, and 
the period of the fraction would be / instead of k = 21. Hence, 
we must conclude that 10 1 + 1 is divisible by p.

p n+ 1 

such that 10* — 1 is divisible by p n and 10* — 1 is divisible by p n + l 
(see the solution of the preceding problem). Consider the difference 

(10* - 1) - (10* - 1) = 10*(10'-* - 1) . 

Since this difference is divisible by />*, 10* - * — 1 is divisible by p n . 
We shall show that W — 1, where d is the greatest common divisor 
of / — k and k , is also divisible by p n . 

Write / — k = qk -b r; we can then write 

10*-* - 1 = 10* t+r - 1 = 10 r (10** - 1) -b (10 r - 1) . 


But 10 ** — 1 = ( 10*) 9 — 1 * is divisible by 10 *— 1 , whence by p n , and 
therefore 10 r — 1 is divisible by p n . Similarly, it may be shown that: 
10 r i — 1 (where r x is the remainder obtained upon division of k by r) 
is also divisible by p n ; that 10 r2 — 1 (where r 2 is the remainder ob¬ 
tained upon division of r by r x ) is divisible by p n \ that 10 ra — 1 (where 
r 3 is the remainder obtained upon division of r t by r 2 ) is divisible by 
p n ; and so on. (This process, by which a diminishing sequence of 
remainders is obtained, is called the Euclidean Algorithm.) 

It is readily shown that the sequence of positive integers r, r u r 2t 
•'• must include the number d\ since both l — k and k are divisible 


Solutions (101)

by d so is r = (/-*) - qk , since both k and r are divisible by d, so 
is r,- since both r and r, are divisible by d, so is r 2 , and so on. 
Consequently, all the (remainders) numbers of the sequence we have 
been forming are divisible by rf; further, this sequence of positive 
integers is decreasing and so must terminate with 0. If the final 
nonzero remainder is r*. then n- , is divisible by r* (since the follow¬ 
ing remainder is zero); r*-, is divisible by r* (since now both r*-, 
and r t are divisible by r*); iv, is divisible by r t (since both r*-* and 
r*-, are divisible by r„), and so on. Finally, * and / * ^ e d ‘ VI ®' ^ 

by V, The inequality > d would contradict the fact that is the 

greatest common divisor of / - k and k\ hence, it e 

r k <d is impossible, since d divides r k ± 0.) . 

Now, k has been defined as the least integer such that 10 1 s 

divisible by p". Therefore, since lO* - 1 is also divisible y P ’ > 
follows that rf = *. and / - * is a multiple of *. which means that / 
is a multiple of k\ that is, l — kt, 

We can expand 10* — 1 as follows.

Since 10* - 1 is divisible by p\ 10* yields a remainder of 1 when 
divided by p. It follows that 10- = 10*-10* yields a remainder of 1 
when divided by p*\ 10- = 10-. 10* yields a remainder of 1 when 
divided by p'\ and so on. Therefore, each term of the parenthetical 
sum on the right, above, yields a remainder of 1 ^.^that ff 
p, and hence the remainder of this sum is r It foU( ^ s ^ at ‘ 
10* ■ fails to be divisible by P^, then the least value of / such that

Second Solution. Consider the left member of the given equation. 
If o ^ * < J_ then all the numbers x, x + —,•••, at + —- are less

the equation holds for such values of x.

the left are “shifted” once to the right, and the final term,

Proceeding by mathematical induction, we shall show that if the 
equality is assumed to hold for an integer n , then it must hold for

If n + 1 is not divisible by k ; then 

n + 1 = qk + r (1 ^ r S k — 1) ,

Third Solution . An elegant geometric solution suggested by the 
second solution will be given. Consider the equilateral hyperbolas 
k 

y ——, or, equivalently, xy — k (of which we shall take only the 
x 

branches in the first quadrant, see Figure 9). 



Figure 9 


We note all the points in the first quadrant which have integral 
coordinates (integer point). Now, if an integer x is a divisor of the 
integer k 9 then the point (x,y) is a point on the graph of the hy¬ 
perbola xy = k . Conversely, if the hyperbola xy — k contains an 
integer point, then the ^-coordinate is a divisor of k. Hence, the 
number of integers 4 which are divisors of the integer k is equal 
to the number of integer points lying on the hyperbola xy — k. The 












188 


Some Problems in Arithmetic 


number t k of divisors of k is thus equal to the number of abscissas 
of integer points lying on the hyperbola xy — k . Now, we make use 
of the fact that the hyperbola xy = n lies “farther out” in the quadrant 
than do xy = 1, xy = 2, xy = 3, • • ■, xy = n — 1. The following im¬ 
plications hold. 

(a) The sum t y + t 2 + * ■ * + t n is equal to the number of integer 
points lying under (or on) the hyperbola xy = n . Each such point 
will lie on a hyperbola xy = k , where k ^ n. The number of integer 
points with abscissa k located under the hyperbola is equal to the 

integral part of the length of the segment MN [Figure 9 (a)]. That

the integers for the integer points located under (or on) the

then (2 — 1/ 2 ) n = a n — b n 1/ 2 (this follows from the binomial formu¬

(2 — 1 / 2 ) n < 1, it follows that 

[(2 + l/T)*] = (2 + 1/~2> + (2 - VTy - 1 , 


and, consequently, 

(2 + l/T)* f(2 + i/"2>] = 1 - (2 - V"2> . 

But since (2 — 1 / 2 )< 1, we can, by taking the power n sufficient¬

it follows that 

[(2 + i/T)»] = (2 + i/T)" + (2 - l/T) n - 1 •

The proof will be carried out by mathematical induction. First, if 
#1 = 1, then fli = 2, b y = 1, and 2 2 — 3*1 = 1. 

Now, assume that for some n 

(2 + l/T)" = a, + b.V~3 , 

where a*. - 3b*. = 1. Then for (2 + we have 

(2 + l/Tr 1 = (a. + bn l/"3 X2 + 1^3 ) = (2 a. + 3W + («. + 2*»)l/^ •

But the number in the braces is clearly an integer, and so the number 
[(1 -1- VT ) 2m ] = 2 m N — 1 is always odd. Hence, if n is even, the 
highest power of 2 by which [(1 + a/ 3 )"] is divisible is zero. 
n is odd. n = 2m + 1. Then 

[(l + VT ) 2m+1 ] = (l + VT) 2m+l + (l - VT) 2m+l

But a m + 3 b m is odd. In fact, 

(a m + 3b m )(a m - 3 b m ) = al - 9 b 2 m = (a* m - 3 bl) - 6b 2 m = l - 6bi 

[see the second solution to problem (a)]. Since 1 — 6 b 2 m is odd, both 
factors, (a* + 3 b m ) and (a m — 3 b m ), are odd. Hence the greatest power 
of 2 by which [(1 + 1 / 3 ) n ] is divisible, for n = 2m + 1, is equal to

problem. For some selected positive integer N we consider all the 
integers of the sequence [a],[2a], [3a], •••, which do not exceed N; 
we shall write these as [a], [2a], * • *, [net]. Since [net] ^ N, where n

N + 1, N + 1 > not ^ N + 1 — a, or net = N + /, where 1 > / ^ 1 — a.

which is wh^t we wished to show. 

110. (a) Let a be the first digit, and 6 the last digit, of the 
desired integer N. Then the integer can be written as 

TV = 1000a + 100a + 10b + b , 


or as 

N = 1100a + 116 = ll(100a + b) . 

Since this integer is to be a perfect square, and since it clearly must 

N 

be divisible by 11, it must also be divisible by 121; that is, -yy- = 
100a + b must be divisible by 11. But 

100a + b — 99a + (a + 6) = 11 "9a + (a + 6) . 

Hence a + b must be divisible by 11. Since neither a nor b exceeds 
9, and since a is not 0, it follows that 1 ^ a + 6 ^ 18, whence 
a + 6 = 11. 

This implies that 


100a + 6 = ll-9a + 11 = ll(9a + 1) , 


N 

121 


100a + b 
11 


= 9a + 1 . 


Since TV is a perfect square, —- is also a square. But among the 

1^1 

integers of form 9a + 1, where a ranges through the integer values 
1 to 9, only 9*7 + 1= 64 is a perfect square. This means that TV = 
121*64 = 7744 = 88 2 . 

(b) Let a be the digit in the tens place of the desired integer, 
and let b be the digit in the units place; that is, the number is 
10a + b. If the order of digits is reversed, the integer becomes 
106 + a. The conditions of the problem yield 


10a + 6 + 106 + a — ll(a + 6) — k 2 , 


where k is an integer. 

It follows that k 2 (hence k) must be divisible by 11; also, a + 6 
must be divisible by 11. Since a + 6 ^ 18, this implies that a + 6 = 11, 
or k 2 = 121. Therefore, the only possibilities for the integers sought 


are 


Solutions ( 110-111) 


197 


29, 38, 47, 56, 65, 74, 83, 92, 

all of which satisfy the conditions of the problem. 

Ill Designate by a the two-digit integer formed by the first two 
digits of the number N sought, and by b the two-digit integer formed 
by the last two digits of N. Then, N - 100. + 4, and the conditions 

of the problem yield 

100a + b = (a + b) 2 , 

which may be written 

99a = (a + bf - (a + b) = (a + bXa + b — V). () 

Thus, the product (a + bXa + b - 1) must be divisible by 99. We 

shall investigate the possible values for a and b. 

(1) a + b = 99*. a + b-l = j. Since a and b are two-digit num¬ 
bers, k g 2. The case k = 2, when used with equation (f), leads 

immediately to a — 99 and b = 99. Similarly, 

k = 1 , 
a + b = 99, 

a = a + b — 1=98, 

N = 9801 = (98 + l) 2 . 

(2) a + b=Um, a + b-l=9n, mn = a. Here we obtain 9«.= 
11* - 1. Since 11* - 1 is thus shown to be divuuUe by 9 ; ^ f ^ y

verified that if there were any other remainder, then

11/ + 6. We now have 

a = mn = (9/ + 5X11/ + 6) = 99Z 2 + 109/ + 30 . 

Since a is to be a two-digit integer we must have < = °; and, 
consequently, a = 30, a + b = 11* = 55, b = 25, N - 3025 - (30 + . 

cos a + 6 = 9m a + b- 1 = llw, mn = a. Reasoning as we did 
above in part (2), we have the single possibility N = 2025 = (20 + 25) 2 . 

(4) a + b = 33m, a + b - 1 = 3», or a + b = 3m, a + b- 1 - 33«, 
which is untenable, inasmuch as a + b and a + b - 1 are relatively 
prime numbers. 

(5) a + b - 1 = 99*, a + b = 


Here we will have

84 or 89 and 95. Further, since (10, + & = 100* + 20*° + y"f t

These four integers satisfy the conditions of the problem

100, -(- lOy + z. The condition of the problem, then, is 
100, + lOy + z = xl + y! + zi . 

Since 71 = 5040 is already a four-digit number, none of the digits 
n exceed 6. Consequently, N cannot exceed 700, which implies 
that no one of the digits can exceed 5 (since 6! = 720). At leas^one

500, but the greatest value obtainable for xl + y\ + z\ is 3-5! = 
360. This, in turn, implies that x cannot exceed 3. Further, it can 
easily be reasoned that x cannot exceed 2; in fact, 3! + 2-5! = 242 < 
300. Now, the number 255 does not fulfill the conditions of the 
problem; if only one digit of the number sought is 5, then x cannot 
exceed 1, since 2! + 5! + 4! = 146 < 200. Moreover, since 1! + 5! + 
4! = 145 < 150, we must conclude that y cannot exceed 4. Con¬ 
sequently, 2 = 5, since we have shown that at least one of the digits 
has to be 5. Therefore, we must have x = 1, 4^y^0, and 2 = 5. 
This allows us to find the one possibility for the solution of the 
problem—a number satisfying the problem’s condition is N = 145. 

(b) The desired numbers N cannot have more than three 
digits, since in the extreme case (9 2 + 9 2 + 9 2 + 9 2 = 4*9 2 = 324) we 
obtain only a three-digit number. Hence we can write, for the inte¬ 
gers, jV= 100* + lOy + 2 , where *,y, and z are the respective digits 
of the number (from left to right, and allowing the possibility of 
* = 0, or even both * = 0 and y = 0). 

The problem then imposes the condition 

100* + lOy + 2 = * 2 + y 2 + 2 2 , 

or, equivalently, 

(100 - *)* + (10 — y)y = 2(2 — 1). ( 1 ) 

The last equation implies that, necessarily, * = 0; if this is not the 
case, we have on the left an integer not less than 90 [* ^ 1, 100 — * ^ 
90, (10 — y)y = 0], and the integer on the right is not more than 
9*8 = 72. Consequently, equation (i) can be replaced by 

(10-y)y = 2 ( 2 - 1 ). 

It is readily verified that this equation cannot be satisfied by any 
nonzero y (recall that y and 2 are digits). If y = 0, then there re¬ 
mains only the trivial possibilities 2 = 0 or 2 = 1. 

Hence, except for N = 0, there is only the solution N= 1. 

114. (a) Clearly, the numbers N which are sought cannot have 
more than four digits, since the sum of the digits of a five-digit 
number cannot exceed 5*9 = 45, and the square of this number is 
2025, a four-digit number. Further, since 4*9 = 36, and 36 2 = 1296, 
if AMs a four-digit number satisfying the condition of the problem, 
its first digit cannot exceed 1. But 1 + 3*9 = 28, and 28 2 = 784, 
whence even four-digit numbers are excluded from consideration. 
Thus can have at most three digits. Assume, now, that = 



200 Equations Having Integer Solutions 

100* + lOy + z, where *, y, and z are digits (the possibility x = 0 is 
allowed, as is x = y = 0). 

Now the condition of the problem can be written in the form 
100* + lOy + z = (* + y + z) 2 , 
or 

99* + 9y = (* + y + z) 2 — (* + y + z) 

= (* + y + z)(* + y + z — 1) . 

It follows from the above equality that one of (* + y + z) or 
(* + y + z — 1) is divisible by 9 (not both can be divisible by 3 since 

they are relatively prime). Also, l^* + y + z^27. We shall in¬ 

vestigate all possible cases. 

(1) * + y + z — 1 = 0; 99* + 9y = 0, * = y — 0, z = 1; N = 1. 

(2) * + y + z = 9; 99* + 9y = 9-8 = 72, * = 0, 9y = 72, y = 8, z = 1; 
N= 81 [= (8 + l) 2 ]. 

(3) * + y + z — 1 = 9; 99* + 9y = 9-10 = 90, * = 0, 9 y — 90, which 
is impossible. 

(4) * + y + z = 18; 99* + 9y = 18* 17 = 306, * = 3, y = l, z = 18 — 
(3 + 1) = 14, which is impossible. 

(5) * + y + z — 1 = 18; 99* + 9y = 19* 18 = 342, * — 3, y = 5, z — 
19 — (3 + 5) = 11, which is impossible. 

(6) * + y + z = 27; 99* +9 y = 27-26 = 702, * = 7, y = 1, z = 27 - 
(7 + 1) = 19, which is impossible. 

Therefore, the conditions of the problem are satisfied only by the 
numbers 1 and 81. 

(b) The cube of a three-digit integer can contain no more 
than nine digits; hence, the sum of the digits of the cube of a three- 
digit number cannot exceed 9-9 = 81 < 100. This implies that the 
numbers sought cannot be three-digit numbers; and the same kind 
of reasoning will show that such a number cannot have more than 
three digits. The integer, or integers, sought can have at most two 
digits. 

The cube of a two-digit integer cannot have more than six digits, 
and the sum of the digits of such a cube cannot exceed 6-9 = 54, 
whence the numbers sought cannot exceed 54. However, if a number 
not exceeding 54 is cubed, the first digit of the cube cannot be 
greater than 1; but then the sum of the digits of the cube cannot be 
greater than 1 + 5-9 = 46. Thus, the numbers sought cannot exceed 
46. 

Proceeding as before, we find that if an integer does not exceed

46. its cube contains at most five digits, and since this cube is Jess

The cube of’44 is a five-digit number ending with the digit 4. Hence 
the number 44 must be thrown out as a possibility. The numbers

positive integer yields the same remainder upon division by 9 as does

as does its cube. This is possible only if this remainder is , > 

ThS'The 11 numbers bought do not exceed 43, and they can yield 
upon division by 9 only the remainders -1, 0, or 1. Only the fo

Of these possibilities, the following integers satisfy the condition of 
the problem:

8 (8 3 = 512); 

17 (17 3 = 4193) ;

positive integers solving the given equation are X 7 ’/> 5 We 
x = 3 f y = 3. We shall show that no solution exists for * = 5. w 

note, first, that 

1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 33 

ends with the digit 3; and 5!,6!,7!,--- all end with the digit 0 
Therefore, if x * 5. the sum 1! + 2! + ■ • - + *’• terminates with the 
digit 3 and therefore cannot be the square of any integer y. 

(b) Two cases will be considered. 


202 


Equations Having Integer Solutions 


z — 2n is an even integer. This case is readily reduced to problem 
(a), inasmuch as y 2n — (y n ) 2 . For even integers z the solutions are 
x = 1; y — 1; z is any even number; 
x = 3; y = ±3; z = 2. 

z is an odd number . For z — 1 any value of x, and the correspond¬ 
ing obvious value of y, will suffice. Let z ^ 3. We note that 

1! + 2! + 3! + ■ • • + 8! = 46,233 . 

This number is divisible by 9, but not by 27, whereas for all n ^ 9 

the number 9! is divisible by 27. The sum 9! + 10! + • • • + x\ is 

therefore divisible by 27; and so, for x ^ 8, the sum 1! + 2! + • ■ • + 
x\ is divisible by 9, but not by 27. In order for y z to be divisible 
by 9 it is necessary that y be divisible by 3, but then y z must be 
divisible by 27 (for z ^ 3). Consequently, for x ^ 8 and z ^ 3 the 
given equation has no solution in integers. 

It remains to consider the case for x < 8. We have 1! = 1 = T, 
where z can be any integer 1! +2! =3 (which does not provide an 

integer solution for z ^ 3), 1! + 2! + 3! = 3 2 (a solution arrived at 

earlier, but not for the case of odd z) and 

1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 33 , 

1! +2! + +5! = 153 , 

1! +2! + ••• +6! = 873, 

1! +2! + +7! =5913. 

As can be easily verified, none of these integers is an integral 
power (^3) of any natural number. Thus, for odd z we have only 
the following additional solutions: 

x — 1; y — 1; z = any odd number; 
x = any natural number; y = 1! + 2! + + jc!; z = l. 

116. Let 

a 2 + b 2 + c 2 + d 2 = 2" . 

We shall designate by p the greatest power of 2 which divides all 
four integers a, 6, c, and d. Upon dividing both sides of the above 
equation by (2 P ) 2 = 2 2p (an even power of 2), we obtain 

a\ + b\ + cl + d\ = 2™~ 2p , 

where at least one of the four integers a u buc u di is odd. If exactly 
one, or if exactly three, of the integers a u b u c u di are odd, then 
a\ + b\ + cl + d\ is odd, and in this event the equality is impossible. 


Solutions ( 116-117) 


203 


If two of the integers are odd, say a v - 2k + 1 and b i 21 + L and 
two are even, say c v = 2m and d, = 2n, then we may wri e 

a \ + b \ + + d\ = 4k 2 + 4k + 1 + 4/ 2 + 4/ + 1 + 4m 2 + 4n 2 

= 2[2(k 2 + k + / 2 + / + w 2 + n 2 ) + 1] > 

which is a contradiction that A + « + A + A = 2-' cannot have an 
odd divisor (the expression in brackets cannot be 1 except for k - 
“Vo- Cr=V = 0 and c = rf = 0). If all four integers are 

Idd that is, ’* = 2* + 1, 6. = 2/ + 1, * = 2m + 1. * = ■*■ + ^ We 

have 

a\ + b\ + c\ + d\ = 4** + 4* + 1 + 4/ 2 + 4/ + 1

= \{k{k + 1) + Id + 1) + m ( m + !) + + 1) + • 

Now the product of two consecutive integers must be an even 
integer, and so the expression in the brackets immediately above i 
odd Under the circumstances, its value can be only _ _ 

implies that n — 2p = 2, n = 2p + 2, and k = l = m = » = 0, 

C ‘ Therefore,if » is an odd number, then 2" cannot be written as 
the sum of four squares; if n = 2p is even, then 2" can e expresse 
as the sum of four squares only in the following way: 

2 2, = (2*-i) 2 + (2 p - ‘) 2 + (2 P_1 ) 2 + (2 p - 1 ) 2 • 

117. (a) First Solution. The equation 
x i + y 2 + z 2 = 2 xyz 

i, satisfied by x = , = r - 0. It is obvious that no other^solution.is 
available which involves zero value for any one of x.y. or 
we may assume that none of them can vanish. We can write 

x = 2®*i , 

y = 2^1 , 

Z = 2?2i , 

where *i,y„zi are odd (if any one of x,y,z is initially odd, then the 

exDonent for 2 can be taken to be 0). 

Since x.y, and z enter the equation symmetrically, we may assume, 
witlT^nerality, that-SjSr We shall now determine by what 
power of 2 the left member of the equation is divisible. 

® If * < 0 S r, or else if « - t = r. then after factoring out 



204 


Equations Having Integer Solutions 


(2 a) 2 — 2 2af , there will remain the sum of an odd and two even 
numbers, or else the sum of three odd numbers—that is, an odd 
number. 

(2) If a = ft < r, then it is possible to write 

x = 2<*(2k + 1) , 
y = 2*(2 1 + 1) , 

2 - 2*-2 m . 

In this case, 

x 2 +y 2 +z 2 = 2 2 *[(2A> + l) 2 + (21 + l) 2 + (2m) 2 ] 

= 2 2 *(4& 2 + 4k + 1 + 4/ 2 + 41 + 1 + 4 m 2 ) 

= 2 2 *+ i [2(fc 2 + k + l 2 + l + m 2 ) + 1] ; 

after factoring out 2 2 ® +1 , there remains in the brackets an odd number. 

On the other hand, the right member of the equation is divisible 
by 2* + P +y+1 . Also, the right member must be divisible by the same 
power of 2 as is the left member. 

For case (1) we must have 2a = a + ft + r + l- Since a < ft ^ r, 
we arrive at the untenable inequality 2a ^ 3a + 1. 

For case (2) it follows that 2a+l=a + ft + r + l. Since a = 
ft < Ty the following inequality is implied, which again is impossible: 
2a + 1 > 3a + 1. 

Therefore, there fails to exist any solution in integers for x 2 + 
y 2 + z 2 = 2 xyz, except the trivial one x = y = z = 0. 

Second Solution. Since the sum of the squares is to be an even 
number, it may be reasoned that either all three of the numbers x 2 y 
y 2 ,z 2 (hence also x,y, and z) are even, or one of them is even and 
two are odd. But in the last event, the sum would be divisible only 
by 2 and the product 2 xyz would be divisible by 4. Hence we must 
conclude that x,y, and z must all be even: x = 2x iy y = 2y u z = 2z x . 
If we substitute these into the given equation and divide through by 
4, we obtain 

X\ + y i + z\ = 4xiy\Z\ . 

As above, this equation implies that x ly y lr and z v are all even 
numbers, and so we can write x t = 2x ly y i = 2 y 2r Zi — 2z ty which 
yields the equation 

x\ + y\ + zl = 9x 2 y 2 z 2 , 

which, in turn, implies that also x 2y y 2y and z 2 are all even numbers. 


Solutions (118) 


205 


Continuation of this process leads to the conclusion that the fol¬ 
lowing set of numbers are all even: 


y, 





Z3 






(the numbers x k ,y k ,z k satisfy the equation xt + yt + zl - 2 k+l x k y k z k ). 

But this is possible only if x = y = z — 0. 

(b) As above, it may be proved that the only integer solution 

of the equation x 2 + y 2 + z 2 + v 2 — 2xyzv is x = y = z — v — 0. Here, 
it suffices to make the special investigation for the case where the 
highest power of 2 which divides x t y f z, and v is the same, that is, 
when 

x = 2*{2k + 1) , y = 2“(2/ + 1), 

2 = 2®(2 m + 1), v = 2*(2 n + 1) , 


where a: is a nonnegative integer, and k, l, m, and n are integers. 
Then 


x z _|_ v z _(_ z 2 4 . = 2 2 *[(4k 2 + 4k + 1) f (4 1 2 + 4/ + 1) 

+ (4 m 2 + 4 m + 1) + (4 n 2 + 4n + 1)] 
__ 2 2 <*+ 2 (k 2 + k + l 2 + / + w 2 + m + n 2 + n + 1 ) 

= 2 ^[kik + 1) + /(/ + 1) + w( m + 1) + n(n +!)+!]. 


Now, the last expression in brackets must be odd (the terms which 
are products of two successive numbers are even). Therefore, the 
greatest power of 2 which divides the left member of the equation 
has exponent 2 a + 2. But, in the original equation, the highest power 
of 2 which divides the right member is 2 , ® +l . Accordingly, we must 
conclude that 2« + 2 = 4« + 1, which is untenable for any integer ar. 

Remark'. A second solution of problem (b), which is analogous to that of 
problem (a), is left to the reader. 


118. (a) Let x, y, z be any three nonnegative integers satisfying 
the equation

Equations Having Integer Solutions 


x 2 + y 2 + z 2 — kxyz .

( 1 ) 

( 2 ) 


(none of the integers on the left of (1) can exceed half the value of 
\xy nght member )- To show this, assume, for example, that z > 
2 ■ Then consider not x,y, z, but the lesser integers x,y, and z t = 
~ z < which clearly also satisfy equation (i): 


x l — v 2 - (kxy — z) 2 = kxy(kxy — z). 


If any integer of this new triple is greater than the product of the 
other two multiplied by we again make a similar substitution 
until the conditions of (2) are satisfied (after which the process will

Assume now that * g y g z. First, since y g z g it follows 


that 


1 <kx_ . 

~ 2 ’ 

kx § 2 . 

Equation (i) can be restated in the form 

Since z g , if i n the left member z is replaced by y g z, the 

numerical value is increased (or remains the same if y = z ); con¬ 
sequently, 

*+? + (!f - i e&L, 

This yields the inequality 

* 2 + 2y 2 ^ kxy 2 . 

Further, it follows from x ^y that 

y 2 + 2y 2 £ kxy 2 ; 


that is, kx ^ 3. 


Solutions (118) 


207 


Hence, we have 2 £ kx ^ 3; that is, kx is equal to 2 or 3. But if 
kx = 2, then equation (i) assumes the form 

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 2yz , 
or 

* 2 + (y - zf = 0 ; 

thus x = 0 and kx = 0 instead of 2. Therefore, kx = 3, which means 
that k can have only value 1 or 3. It is readily verified by examples 
that these values for k are possible [see the solution of problem (b)]. 

(b) Reasoning similar to that employed for problem (a) is 
used here. There we had x 2 + 2y 2 ^ kxy 2 ; since kx = 3, this inequality 
can be rewritten in the form 

* 2 + 2y 2 ^ 3y 2 , 
or 

x 2 ^ y 2 . 

However, we assumed x ^ y; consequently, x = y. Assume now 
that in the basic equation, (i), x = y, kx = 3. We obtain 

2x 2 + z 2 — 3xz , 
or 

(z — x)(z — 2x) = 0 . 

Thus, z = x or z = 2x. Since 

^ kxy _ 3y __ 3x 

“ 2 2 2 ’ 

it is impossible for z to be equal to 2x. Therefore, z = x. 

Accordingly, for condition (2) to be fulfilled, we must have x = 
y = z. But, inasmuch as kx = 3, x can be only 1 or 3, and we obtain 
two solutions for equation (1); 

x = y = z = 1 (k — 3) ; 
x = y = z = 3 (A = 1) . 

In the solution of problem (a) we saw that any three integers x, 
y, z which satisfy condition (i) can produce other solutions, by suc¬ 
cessive replacements of the form z i = kxy — z of (2). But if Zi = 
kxy — z, then z = kxy — zr, hence every solution of equation (1) can 
be obtained from the least solution by successive substitutions of 
form z i = kxy — z. In particular, we obtain in this way the following 
solutions for equation (1) (up to 1000):

thfnmhll the *' elati ;' ely P rime Pair x,y is to meet the conditions of 
the problem, the following equations must be solvable in integers: 

x 2 + 125 = uy , 
y 2 + 125 = vx . 


Solutions (119) 


209 


We shall show that a solution of these equations produces not merely 
the relatively prime pair x and y satisfying the conditions, but two 
other pairings x, u and y, v which satisfy the same conditions. That 
is, we shall show that x 2 + 125 is divisible by u and u 2 + 125 is 
divisible by x, and also that y 2 + 125 is divisible by v and v 2 + 125 
is divisible by y. 

First, x 2 + 125 = uy means that x 2 + 125 is divisible by u . The 
equalities yield 

u 2 y 2 = x 4 + 250a: 2 + 125 2 ; 
u\vx - 125) = a; 4 + 250a: 2 + 125 2 , 

and, finally, 

x(u 2 v - a: 3 - 250a:) = 125(« 2 + 125) , 

from which it follows that u 2 + 125 is divisible by x (which is rela¬ 
tively prime to 125, otherwise x and y would not be relatively prime). 
Also, the integers x and u are relatively prime, for if x and u had 
a common divisor of d t then 125 = uy — x 2 would also be divisible by 
d (that is, d = 5), and, consequently, y would be divisible by d (since 

= vx — 125). It may be shown, in exactly the same way, that the 
integers y and v are relatively prime, and the square of either when 
increased by 125 is divisible by the other. 

We redesignate our integers x, y t u, v as follows: x = x Q} y = x lt 
u = x-u v = x 2 . If u 2 + 125 = x~ 2 x f then the pair of integers u f x~ 2t 
that is, x- lf x- 2 , also satisfy the conditions of the problem. Thus, if 
v 2 + 125 = x 3 y, then the pair of integers v, * 3 , that is, x 2r x 3 , also 
satisfy this condition. Hence, beginning with an integer pair satis¬ 
fying the conditions of the problem, it is possible to construct an 
infinite double-end array of integers, 

■ • X- 2f X-u X Q , Xi f X 2t 

where neighboring pairs satisfy the equation

Xq +i = tXq — *«-! , 

Xq -1 — tXq Xq+i . 


Now we must develop a procedure which will help us determine 
all such arrays which yield solutions of the problem. We note, first, 
that if x*+i ^ x a , then

and if x a -i ^ x a , then x*- 2 > Xa-u hence every chain of integers 
augments in both directions from some least integer (or equal pair 
of least integers, and two neighboring numbers of the chain can be 
equal only if both are 1). 

Let Xa be the least integer of the solution-chain: 

X\ ^ X 0 , X-i ^ X 0 . 

We shall show that x Q < yT25 < 12. 

We first observe that the number /, referred to above, is an integer 
exceeding 2. In fact, it follows from the equation 


Xa-i + Xq+i Xq + 


that / is an integer. Hence x a and x a+l are relatively prime, and 
consequently 

^ Xq—i Xq +1 


cannot have in its denominator a divisor of Xq+ 1 , and 

t = Xq + Xq +2 
Xq + l 


cannot have in its denominator any divisor of x a . Further,

Solutions (120) 

If we add the equations of (2), we obtain 


213 


(2v — 3)* + (2 w — 3)y -F (2/ — 3)2 + (2s — 3 )u 

+ v 2 + + t 2 + s 2 = 0 . (2) 

Note that in equation (2) at least one of the numbers 2v — 3, 2 w — 3, 
2/ — 3, 2s — 3 is negative; otherwise there would be on the left of 
the equation the sum of positive integers. Let us assume that 
2v — 3 < 0; This is possible only if v = 0 or v = 1. In the first 
event, the first equation of system (1) yields y + z + u — 0, which is 
untenable for y, z , u all positive. Hence it must be assumed that all 
the integers v 7 iv 7 t,s are positive, and that v = \. In this event 
equation (2) can be rewritten in the form 

x — (2 w — 3)_y -F (2 1 — 3)2 + (2s — 3 )u + iv z + t 2 -F s 2 + 1 . (3) 

We now consider the several possibilities. 

The numbers x t y,z,u are all distinct . Here, the integers v 7 iv,t,s 
are also all different; if, for example, v = w, the difference of the 
first two of the equations (1) yields y — x = 2v(x — y), which is im¬ 
possible for positive v and x =£ y. Further, if we assume v = 1, the 
first of equations (i) yields 2x = y + z -F u — 1, 



1,1 1 


which is inconsistent with equation (5), where the coefficients of y f 
2, u in the right member are positive integers (since w, /, or s cannot 
be equal to 1 because they are distinct from v which is equal to 1). 
Therefore, this case is not possible. 

Precisely two of the integers x, y , 2, u are equal. Here we must 
separately investigate two cases. 

If 2 = u, then t = 5. Equation (3) and the first of equations (i) 
now yield: 

x = (2 w - 3 )y + 2(2 1 - 3)2 + w 2 + 2/ 2 + 1 ; 

2x = y + 2z — 1 . 

As before, these equations are inconsistent. 

If x — y 7 then w = v = 1 . Equation (2) and the first of equations 
(. 1 ) yield, respectively, 

2tX = (2/ — 3)2 -F (2s — 3 )u -F t 2 -I- s 2 -F 2 ; 

X = 2 + u — 1 . 




214 


Equations Having Integer Solutions 


Substituting the second equality in the first, we have 

(2 1 - 5)z + (25 - 5)w + / 2 + s 2 + 4 = 0 , (4) 

from which it follows that at least one of the two members 2/ — 5 
or 2 s — 5 must be negative. Assume 2 / — 5 < 0 ; since / > 0 and / =£ 1 
(for v = 1, / =£ v, since z =£ x) f it follows that t = 2 . Now, if twice 
the first of equations (i) is added to the third equation, we obtain 

4z + 4x + 6 = 4x + 2z + 3« , 

3 

that is, z = — u — 3. Substituting this into equation (4), along with 
/ = 2 , we have 

(45 - 13)« + 25 2 + 22 = 0 . 

Clearly, 45 — 13 < 0. Since 5 > 0, 5 =£ 1 , 5 4= 2 , we must have 5 = 3. 
If these values are now substituted into equations (i), there results 
a system of three linear equations in three unknowns: 

JC + Z+ tt = 25 + l, 

2x + u — 4z + 4 , 

2x + z = 6 m + 9 . 

We easily find that x( = y) = 96, z = 57, u = 40. 

The integers x,y,z,u are ttvo pairs of equal numbers. Assume that 
x = y and z = u. In this event, the first of equations (i) yields x = 
2 z — 1 ; if this is substituted in ( 2) f we obtain 

x = (2/ - 3)z + / 2 + 1 , 

and so 

(2/ - 5)z + / 2 + 2 = 0 . 

It follows that 2t — 5 < 0, and since / > 0, t 4= 1, we have / = 2. 
Equations (1) may now be written 

x + 2 z = 2x + 1 , 

2x + 5 = 4z + 4 , 
whence x(= y) — 11 , z(= u) = 6 . 

Three of the integers x, y t z, u are equal . It is necessary to consider 
two cases. 

If y = z — u, then equations (3) and the first of equatians (i) take 
on the form

X = 3(2 w - 3)y + 3w* + 1; 

2 * = 3 > - 1 , 

and these, clearly, are inconsistent. 

If x = y = z, then the first of equations (i) is 

2x + u = 2x + 1 , 

from which we find x = 1. The last of equations (I) becomes

The last equation has 2/* — 1 solutions, where jj. is the number of 
divisors of the integer a 2 (including 1 and a 2 as divisors). To obtain

leads to the unsatisfactory result x = y = 0.

where m, n, t are arbitrary integers. 

124. (a) It is readily reasoned from the equation x v — v* that thA 
prime divisors of , and y must be the same: 

* = PVP?- • -Pl k ; 
y = Pf'Pp- ■ -Pi *; 

where p lt p u -••,/>* are prime numbers. In view of this, and the

We shall assume y > x. It follows that

Consequently, y is divisible by *, or y = kx, for some integer k We 
may rewrite our equation as

If we take the *th root on both sides, we obtain x k = kx, or x k ~ l = k. 
Since y > x, then k > 1, which implies x > 1. But 2 Z_1 = 2, and for 
k > 2 we always have x k ~ l > In fact, if k > 2 and * ^ 2, then 

jt-i ^ 2*- 1 > £ , 

since already 2 3_1 > 3; and for k = 2, x > 2,

Therefore, the only solution of the problem, in positive integers, is 
x = 2, £ = 2, y — kx = 4. 

(b) We shall designate the ratio by &, whence y = If 
we substitute this for y in the equation, we obtain

Since p and q are relatively prime, in order for x and y to be

of p + q. But since, for q ^ 2 and p = n q , we have the following 
inequality 


n q < p + q < (n + 1)< = n q + pn q ~ l +

125. Let n be the number of eighth-grade students who participated, 
and let m be the number of points assumed by each of them. The 
total number of points won in the tournament is then nm + 8. This 
number clearly is also equal to the number of games played. Since 
there were, altogether, n + 2 players in the tournament, and each 
played (n + 1) games (one with each remaining player), there was a 
in + 2 )(n + 1) 

total of --^- - games played (two players to each game, 

hence we divide by 2). Therefore, we have 



Now, n is an integer, as is the number in parentheses (since m is 
either an integer or a fraction having denominator 2). 

Since n must divide 14, n can be only one of the numbers 1,2,7, 
or 14. We must discard the possibilities n = 1 and n — 2, since in 
either of these cases the total number of participants could not have 
exceeded 4 and the two seventh graders could not have amassed as 
many as 8 points. 

There remain the possibilities n = 7 and n — 14. If n = 7, then 
7(7 + 3 - 2m) = 14; m = 4. If n = 14, then 14(14 + 3-2 m) = 14; 
m — 8. Hence, there are two answers: n — 7 and n — 14.

128. (a) The problem clearly involves the solution, in integers, 
of the equation 

x 2 ~h y 2 = z 2 . 

If t is the greatest common divisor of x, y, and z, we may factor 
out t 2 from both sides of the equation to obtain an equivalent equation 
(having the same solution triples *,y, z); hence, we shall assume from 
the beginning that there is no common divisor for x f y,z. This will 
imply that each pair of integers is relatively prime, since if two of 
the integers have a common divisor, that number must also divide 
the remaining integer. 

Since now x,y,z are assumed to be relatively prime, it follows 
that at most one of these unknowns can be even; if two them, for 
example, are even, then the third must be even, and hence they 
would not be relatively prime. Further, if x and y are both odd, 
say x = 2 k + 1 and y = 21 + 1, we must have 

* 2 + y 2 = (2k + l) 2 + (21 + l) 2 = 2[2(£ 2 + l 2 + k + /) + 1] . 

Now, the square of the integer z is odd if z is odd, or divisible by 
4 if z is even. Since the expression on the right for x 2 + y 2 is not 
divisible by 4, we must conclude that x 2 -f y 2 must be an odd number, 
and so one of the integers x, y is even and the other odd; also z is

Equations Having Integer Solutions 


The equation may now be written in the form 

(2*i) 2 = 2 2 - y 2 , 

or, 

2 _z+y z-y 
X ' ~ ~2 2 ’ 

Let —= u and —~ v > then z = u + v and y = u — v. The 

integers u and v (recall that z and y are both odd) must be relatively 
prime (otherwise z and y would not be relatively prime). Hence 
since their product is a perfect square, each of them is a perfect 
square; that is, u — a 2 and v — b 1 for some integers a and b. Finally, 
we have 

z = u + v = a 2 -\-b 2 y 
y = u — v = a 2 — b 2 , 

Xi = 1 /uv = ab , 

or, if now we relieve the condition that x y y, z be relatively prime 
x = 2 tab , 
v = t(a 2 — b 2 ) , 
z = t(a 2 -I- b 2 ) , 

where a and b arbitrary relatively prime integers, a > b y and / is an 
arbitrary integer. 

These formulas yield all solutions of the problem. 

(b) We shall designate the sides of the triangle by x y y y and 
z (z being the side opposite the 60° angle). Using the law of cosines 
from trigonometry, we have z 2 = x 2 + y 2 — xy. 

We must solve this equation in integers. It is convenient to use 
a rather indirect method; we can put the equation into the format 

[4z + (x + v)] 2 = [2z + 2(x + y)] 2 + [3(x — y)] 2 , 


where u = 2z + 2(x + y), v = 3(x — y), and w — A z + (x + y). Now the 
result of problem (a) can be used to obtain 

u = 2 tab , 
v = t(a 2 — b 2 ) , 
w = t(a 2 + b 2 ) ,

But 2 cos A — - , and so in the integral triangle 2 cos ,4

Q 

gers. Then, by (i), we have 

a : b : c — q 2 : pq : (p 2 — ^ 2 ) . 

If p and are relatively prime, then the three integers q 2 y pq y and 
p % — q 2 do not have any common divisor other than 1. It follows 
that in all triangles satisfying the given condition B = 2A and having 
least integral sides (not having a common divisor) the lengths of the 
sides are expressible by the formulas 

a = q 2 , 
b = pq , 
c = /> 2 - q 2 > 

where p and q are relatively prime integers. 

In order actually to determine the triangle, where B — 2A y the 
numbers p and q must satisfy the following condition: the angle A = 

arccos-—- must be such that 0 < A < 60° (A must be less than 60°, 
2 q i 

since A + J9 + C = 3A + C = 180°). Since cos 0 = 1 and cos 60° = —, 

P ^ 

this condition can be rewritten as 2 > — > 1. The least integers p 

Q 

and q satisfying this condition are p = 3, q = 2. It follows that the 
smallest triangle with integral sides satisfying the condition B = 2A 
will be the one having sides a = 4, b = 6, c = 5. 

We proceed now to problems (b) and (c). Here it will be necessary 
to use trigonometric functions of A to express sin5A, sin6A, and 
sin7A. Successive applications of the identity involving the sine of 
the sum of angles [or using the general formula of problem 222 (b) 
given in the “Problems” section] yields the following identities: 

sin 5A = (2 cos A ) 4 sin A — 3(2 cos A ) 2 sin A -f sin A , 
sin 6 A = [(2 cos A ) 2 — 1][(2 cos A ) 2 — 3]2 cos A sin A , 
sin 7 A = [(2 cos A ) 2 — 2][(2 cos A ) 2 — 3]4 cos 2 A sin A — sin A . 

The calculations are then carried out exactly as in problem (a). 



228 


Equations Having Integer Solutions 


Assume that 2 cos A = (Plq), where p and q are relatively prime 
integers; It follows from the identities for sin 5 A, sin 6A, and sin 
7 A that triangles with integral (nonreducible) sides whose angles 
satisfy the condition B—nA y where n — 5 or 6, have sides satisfying 
the following formulas: 

(b) For n — 5, 

a = q % , 

b = q(p* - 3p 2 q 2 + q 4 ), 
c = P(P 2 - q 2 )(P 2 - 3**); 

(c) For « = 6, 

a = , 

6 = - <? 2 )(/> 2 - 3? 2 ), 

c = PKP 2 - 2<? 2 )(/> 2 - 3q 2 ) - ^ . 

(Here, p and q are relatively prime integers.) 

In order that a triangle be actually determined by these numbers, 
and where B = nA t the integers p and q must be such that: 

(b') For n — 5, 


0 < arc cos < 30° , 


(c') For n = 6, 


0 < arc cos ■$- <

Since cos 30° = V ^ ~ y i nte £ ers p and q t for n — 5, must satisfy 

the condition 2 > > 1 / 3 = 1.732 **• . The least integers p and 

Q 

q which satisfy this condition are p — 1 and q = 4 (q cannot be less 

than 4 because — differs from a whole number by less than -^-).

Therefore, the smallest triangle with integral sides, in which B=

For n — 6, the integers p and q must satisfy the condition

is to be a perfect square, each of the factors must separately be 
perfect squares: 

i = x\,

The last equation says that the under the initial assumption there 
exists a right-angle triangle with sides t — x\ and u = y\ and hypo¬ 
tenuse Z\j where x if y u and z l are again positive integers and, of par¬ 
ticular importance, < z [since, further, zl = (t 2 + u z ) z =a z <a z +b z =z]. 
Hence, if there exists any right-angle triangle each of whose legs 
are squares of integers, and whose hypotenuse is an integer, then 
there exists another such triangle which has a smaller hypotenuse. 
Employing the same reasoning we can construct a succession of these 
triangles with decreasing hypotenuse. Since all such hypotenuse 
lengths are integral, we must arrive at a triangle whose hypotenuse 
is of length 1. But this is a contradiction since 1 cannot be a sum 
of squares of two positive integers.

Remarks'. If we “guess at” the results we expect to obtain (which is often 
quite feasible, if we try a few small values for n), we can often prove the

where N is the number of integers writing l + a = x,

which is the formula for the sum of a geometric progression.

138. It will be shown by mathematical induction that the sum we 

seek to determine is equal to-i-. First, the proposition is 

2 ’ * * an 

obviously valid for n = 1. Now, assume that the assertion is valid 
for n — 1 positive integers, and consider the sum S of the given frac¬ 
tions for n integers. From each of the nl terms of the sum S, we 

can factor out the fraction---, since this final factor 

fli + at + • * ■ + a n 

has as its denominator the sum of all the n positive integers (the 
order of the addition being unimportant, since no integer is omitted). 
Further, grouping in the parentheses separately the (« — 1)! terms 
corresponding to those permutations of indices where the index 1 is 
missing, the (n — 1)! terms corresponding to the permutations where 
the index 2 is missing, and so on, we arrive at n separate sums, to 
each of which we can apply the induction hypothesis, since each 
comprises (n — 1) integers; for example, a 2t <z 3 , • ■ ',a n , or a u a u ■ • 
and so on. 

Summing these, and using the induction hypothesis, we obtain

It is clear that the fraction on the left exceeds 1 if n ^ 50. We

less than 48. 

Therefore, we finally obtain: 99™+ 100” is greater than 101™ if «^48 
and is less than 101™ if n > 48. 

144. We first show that the product of n consecutive natural num¬ 
bers is greater than the nth power of the square root of the product 
of the first and last of these numbers. Let the n integers be 
a, a + 1, • * -, a + n — 1. Then the kth number from the beginning 
will be a + k — 1, and the &th number from the end will be a+n—k. 
Their product is 



244 


Evaluating Sums and Products 


{a + k — l)(a + n — k) = a 1 + an — a + (k — l)(n — k) 

^ a* + an — a = a(a + n — 1), 

where the equality is obtained only for k = 1 or k = n. That is, the 
product of two positive integers equidistant respectively from each 
end of the sequence (for odd n, these two integers are taken to be 
the common middle one) always exceeds the product of the two ex¬ 
treme (first and last) integers. But then we have, for the product of 
all the numbers, 

a{a + 1) ■ ■ • (a + n - 1) 

^ [a(a + n — l)] n/2 = [i/a(a + n — 1)]", 
where the equality holds only if n = 1 or n = 2. 

We shall show now that 300! > 100 300 . We have

201 • • • 300 > 1/200^ ■ x/300 100 = 10 200 • 2 50 * 3 50 . 


If we multiply together all the left members of these inequalities 
and compare the result with the product of all the right members, 
we obtain

Remark. A more general result is shown in problem 148. 

145. We first show that, for any natural number k S n, 



n n 2 


We use mathematical induction. The proposition is obviously true 
for k = 1. Assume now that the proposition holds for a particular 
value of k. We shall show that it then holds for k + 1. We have

We do not need here the fact that hence the inequality is 

valid for any integral value of k. Assume now that k g n. Then.

since n(k + 1) > k* if n ^ k.

It follows, by the principle of mathematical induction, that (i) is 
valid for all natural numbers «. 

We now deal with the inequality

We show that this inequality holds for all integers n > 6. With the 
aid of logarithm tables (natural logarithms are used here) it is readily 
verified that inequality (2) is valid for n — 7:

that is, 6! < for In 6! = In 720 * 6.58, and In (^jj = 7(ln 7-1)

if x > 1, then the first term is numerically the greatest, but if *<1,

= (a + b + c)(a 2 + b 2 + c 2 — ab — ac — be) . 

Second Solution. If in problem 161 we substitute x for a , we have 
x 2 + b 3 + c 3 — 3 xbc = 0, if x + b + c = 0. Consequently, the equation 
x 3 — 3 bex + b 3 + c 3 = 0 has a root x — —b—c, from which it follows 
that the polynomial x 3 — 3 bex + b 3 + c 3 is divisible by x — (~b — c) = 
x + b + c. If in this result we resubstitute a for x, we find that 
a 3 + b 3 + e 3 — 3 abe is divisible by a + b + c. Ordinary division pro¬ 
duces the other factor: 

a 3 + b 3 + c 3 — 3 abe = (a + b + c)(a 2 + b 2 + c 2 — ab — ac — be) . 

(b) First solution . We have 
[(a + b + c) 3 — a 3 ] — ( b 3 + c 3 ) 

= [(a + b + c) — a] [(a + b 4- c) 2 + a(a + b 4- c) + a 2 ] 

- (b + c)(b 2 — be + c 2 ) 

= (b + c){[(a + b + c) 2 — b 2 ] + a(a + c) 

+ (ab -1- be) + (a 2 — c 2 )} 

= (b + c){[(a + b + e) — b] [(a + b 4- c) + b] + a(a 4- c) 

+ b(a + c) + (a + c)(a — c)} 

= (b -h e)(a ■+■ c)(a -\-b-\-c~\~b-\~a-\-b-\-a — c) 

= 3 (b + c)(a + c)(a + b) . 

Second Solution. Substitute, in the given expression, x for a : 

(x 4- b + c) 3 — x 3 — b 3 — c 3 . 

If x = — b, the expression vanishes; consequently, the equation 
(x + b + c) 3 — x 3 — b 3 — c 3 = 0 has as a root x = — b> and so U+6+c) 3 — 
x 3 — b 3 — c 3 is divisible by x + b. Resubstituting a for x , we can 
conclude that (a + 6 + c) 3 — a 3 — b 3 — c 3 is divisible by a + b. 

It is similarly shown that (a + b + c) 3 — a 3 — b 3 — c 3 is also divisi¬ 
ble by a 4- c and by b + c. We can write (since the three factors 
are clearly relatively prime) 

(a + b + c) 3 — a 3 — b 3 — c 3 = k(a + b)(a + c)(b + c) . 

In order to determine the factor k , it suffices to equate, in this 
equality, the coefficients of any like term from each side: for example, 
the coefficient of a 2 b . If we set a = 0, b = c — 1, then we find k = 3.

167. We shall find two numbers a and b to satisfy the equation 
x 3 + px + q = x 3 + a 1 + b 3 — 3 abx . 

To do this, we must solve for a and b the following two equations 
in two unknowns: 


a 3 + b 3 = q, ab — , 

or, equivalently, 

a 3 + b 3 = q, a 3 b 3 = - ^ . 

Now, it is easily verified that a 3 and b 3 are roots of the quadratic 

A3 

equation z 2 — qz — — 0, and, consequently, we will have 1 



Now, in view of the result of problem 162 (a), we have 
x 3 + px + q = x 3 + a 3 + b 3 — 3 abx 

— (a + b + x)(a z + b 2 + x z — ab — ax — bx) . 

Therefore, the solution of the cubic equation reduces to the solution 
of the first-degree equation

168. First Solution . We designate Va -f x by y, thereby obtaining 
a system of two equations: 

T /a + x = y , — y = * . 

We square these equations to obtain 

a + x = y 2 , a — y = x 2 . 

If the second equation is subtracted from the first, the result is 

* + y = y 2 - * 2 , 


*2 _ y 2 - 1 - x + y = (x + y) (x — y + 1 ) = 0 . 

Two possibilities arise. First, 

* + y = 0 ; 

then y = — x and x 2 — x — a — 0 , which yields 




x — y - 1 - 1 = 0 ; 

then y = x + 1 and x 2 + x + l — a = 0, from which we obtain 


• 4 = _ T ± / a -T- 


These possibilities for the roots of the given equation must be 
tested in order to eliminate any extraneous roots.

but will not have a root for a < 1.

Second Solution. We clear the radicals from the equation in the 
usual way: 

a — \/ a + x — a 2 , 

(a - a 2 ) 2 = a + * , 
x 4 — 2 ax 1 — a + a 2 — a = 0 . 

We now have an equation of degree 4. However, this equation is 
quadratic in the letter a; we shall use the device of solving for a in 
terms of a: 

a 2 - (2a 2 + l)a + a‘ - x = 0 , 

2a 2 + 1 ± t/4a 4 + 4a 2 + 1 - 4** + 4*

«, = ** + * + 1 , a 2 = a 2 - a . 

The equation 

a 2 - ( 2a 2 + l)a + x* - x = 0 

has the two roots 

a, = a 2 + a + 1 , ai = x 2 — x , 
and so we can write 

a 2 - (2a: 2 + l)a + x* - x = (a - a,) (a - a 2 ) 

= (a - a 2 - x - 1 )(a •- a 2 + a) . 

Therefore, we can write the quartic equation in the form 

(a 2 — a — a) (a 2 + a — a + 1 ) = 0 . 

This is readily solved to yield

Then the equation takes on the form

We note that x is expressed in terms of y x by a quadratic formula

It follows that if we graph the functions 

y = x 1 + 2 ax + “

the line bisecting the first quadrant (See Figure 10; every point x=

^-coordinates for which y =y these coordinates yield the roots of 
the equation. These points must lie on the axis of symmetry of the 
two curves, satisfying the conditions

It is left to the reader to convince himself that for 0 < a < 4

If 0 < a < —, the first two roots are real and satisfy the initial 
equation; the last two roots are complex numbers. 


170. (a) To yield a real number for the left member, for real 
values of *, the expressions under the radicals in the left member 
must all be positive. Let us designate these radicands, respectively, 
starting from the innermost one (from 3*), by y\,yl, •• '>yl~ u yl\ we 
then have 


3x = * + 2x = yl; 
x + 2 y t = yl , 
* + 2 y 2 = yl r 


X + 2y n -2 = JVn-1 , 

* + 2y n -i = yl , 

where all the numbers y lt y 2 > • • •, y n are real and positive. The initial 
equation takes on the form, in the new designation, 

y n = x . 

We shall now prove that y v = x. Assume that x > y u Then a 
comparison of the first and second equations shown above will indicate 
that yi > y 2 . Similarly, the second and third equations will imply 
that y 2 > : Va; we can continue, in a similar manner, to find 

y 3 > y< > • • • > yn -1 > yn . 

Hence if x > y if then x > y n , which contradicts the equation y n = x. 
The assumption x < yi will lead, by analogous reasoning, to a similar 
contradiction. Hence we must have yi = x. 

Since yl = 3x , it follows that 

3x = x 2 , 

and so we may set down two possible values for x: 

*i = 3, *2 = 0. 

Both values satisfy the given equation.

If we again repeat this substitution, we obtain new equations of the same form, 
except that we have, successively, 3», 4n, ••• radical signs. Thus we arrive 

at

which yields x = /3*7a: a = 3a;; consequently, xi = 0, a; 2 = 3. This shows that 
the roots of equation (1) do not depend upon n [since the roots of (2) are in¬ 
dependent of n]. 

The reasoning used here cannot be considered a legitimate solution to the 
problem, inasmuch as the existence of the limit shown in (2) has not been es¬ 
tablished and hence cannot be legitimately employed for (3). However, the 
reasoning can be rigorously justified by a more advanced discussion, which is 
not undertaken here.

left member:

We finally arrive at an equation of form 

ax + b 
cx + d ~ X ’ 

where a, b r c, and d are some integers (depending upon n). This 
equation is in fact a quadratic equation x(cx + d) = ax 4 - b, which 
implies that the given equation can have at most two roots and hence 
cannot be an identity (since then all values of x would satisfy it; in 
particular x = 0 fails to satisfy the equation). 

Without an assignment of value for n we apparently cannot de¬ 
termine these roots. However, let us assume that 



The successive simplifications of the fraction yield 




and we finally arrive at the identity x — x. Hence, under the assump¬ 
tion, the roots of 1 + = x, or x 2 — x — 1 = 0 , that is, 



satisfy the given equation. Since the equation has at most two roots, 
and we have found two roots for it, these represent the complete 
solution of the problem. 


Remark : We display still another method for solving the equation [compare 
this with the remark following the solution of problem (a)]. 

We substitute for the final x shown in the “multi-storied” fraction* its 
expression as given by the equation itself. We then have an equation of pre¬ 
cisely the same form, except with 2 n fractional designations.** ' Continuation 
of the process leads finally to our writing

of which we made use has not been proved. However, a rigorous proof can 
be given by more advanced mathematics.

where | y | means the positive numerical value of y. 

We consider the several possibilities. 

First, if V * — 1 — 2^0 and Vx — 1—3^0, that is, if V * — 1 ^ 3 , 
x — 1 ^ 9, * ^ 10 , then |i/F—T— 2 I = Vx — 1 — 2 , \ ]/x 3 | = 

\/x — 1 — 3, and the equation takes on the form 


Vx - 1-2 + Vx -1-3 = 1 . 

Hence, 

2 l/F=T= 6 

*—1=9, 

* = 10 . 

If t/* — 1 — 2^0 and i/* — 1 —3 ^ 0 , that is, if Vx — 1 ^ 2 , x ^ 
5, but i/* — 1 ^ 3, x ^ 10 , then | i/*— 1 — 2 | = i/*— 1 — 2 , \V x — \ — 
3 | = — Vx — 1 + 3, and the equation becomes the identity 

Vx=T- 2 - Vx -T+ 3 = 1 . 

Therefore, the equation is satisfied by all values of x between *=5 
and x = 10 . 

If Vx — 1 — 2 ^ 0 , Vx — 1—3^0, that is, if Vx — 1 ^ 2 , * 5; 5, 
then |i/* — 1 — 2 | = — i/* — 1 + 2 , | l/* — 1 — 3 | = — V x — \ + 3, 
and the equation becomes 


- Vx — 1 + 2 — Vx -1+3 = 1 . 


It follows that 


*-1=4, 
x — 5 . 

The case Vx — 1 — 2 ^ 0 , Vx — 1 — 3^0, is impossible. 

In summary, all values of x between 5 and 10, inclusive, that is, 
5 ^ * ^ 10, are solutions of the given equation. 

172. We shall first look for the real roots lying in the interval 2

finally — oo to — 1 . 

Let * ^ 2 . Then* + 1>0, * > 0, * — 1 > 0, * — 2^0; hence |*+1| =

equation 


Solutions (172)

* + 1 - * + 3 (* - 1 ) - 2 (* - 2 ) = * + 2 , 
which is an identity. 

Accordingly, all real numbers greater than 2, and 2 itself, are 
roots of the given equation. 

Let 1 ^ * < 2. Then * + l>0, *>0, * — 1^0, and * — 2 < 0, 
which implies 

| * + 1 I = * + 1 , 

|*|=*, 

l*-l| =x-l, 

I * — 2 | = — (* — 2) . 

We obtain, for this case, the equation 

* + 1 - * + 3(* - 1) + 2(* - 2) = * + 2 . 

This yields 4 * = 8 , or * = 2 . This value lies in the interval pre¬ 
viously considered. Consequently, there is no additional root found 
between 1 and 2 for the given equation. 

Let 0 ^ * < 1. Then | * + 1 | = * + 1, | * | = *, I * — 1| = — (* — 1), 
and | * - 2 | = - (* - 2). We have 

* + 1 - * - 3(* - 1) + 2(* - 2) = * + 2. 

This yields *= -1, but since this lies outside the interval which 
we used to set up the equation, it must be discarded. 

There exists no additional root for the equation in the interval 
0 ^ * < 1 . 

Let — 1 ^ * ^ 0. Then | * + 1 | = * + 1, | * | = —*, I * — 1 I = 

—(* — 1 ), and | * — 2 | = —(* — 2). We have 

* + 1 + * - 3(* - 1) + 2(* - 2 ) = * + 2 . 

This equation is contradictory; hence there are no roots between —1 
and 0 , inclusive. 

Finally, let * < —1. Then | * + 1 | = —(* + 1), | * | = —*, | * — 1| = 

-(* - 1), and | * - 2 | = — (* - 2); We have 

-(* + 1 ) + * - 3(* - 1) + 2(* - 2) = * + 2 , 

*= -2 . 

We obtain the root * = —2 from this interval. Therefore, the equa¬ 
tion is satisfied by — 2 , by 2 , and by all real numbers exceeding 2 .

Figure 11 shows in light lines the functions y\ = | x + 1 |, y% = — | * |, y% ~ 
3 | x — 11, y* ~ —2 | x — 2 |, and y% — — (x + 2), and in heavy lines the function 
y = y\ + yz + y% + y\ + ys (by “composition” of graphs). It is clear from the 
figure that y crosses the axis at x = — 2 and at x = +2, and thereafter remains 
on the x axis for x > 2.

173. From the first equation of the given system we see that 
y 2 = x 2 , y = zt x . 

If we substitute for y 2 in the second equation, we obtain 

(x - a) 2 + - 1 , ( 1 ) 

which, as a quadratic equation, in general yields two possible values 
for x . Since each value of x can be associated with two values of 
y, the system will have at most four solutions; This will reduce to 
at most three solutions if one of the values of x is zero, since this 
value will go with only one companion value for y, that is, y = 0 . 
If we substitute x = 0 into equation (I) we obtain 

a 2 = 1 , a = dh 1 . 

The system can, and will, have precisely three solutions only for 
these values of a .

The number of solutions of the system reduces to two if the quadra¬ 
tic equation involving x has only one solution (a “double root ). 
The quadratic equation 

(x — a) 2 + x 2 = 1 , 

or, 

2x 2 — 2ax + a 2 — 1 = 0 

will have one root if and only if the discriminant (B 2 - ±AC) vani¬ 
shes; that is, if 

a 2 - 2(a 2 - 1 ) = 0 , 

or, a 2 = 2; that is, a = ± V 2 . 

174. (a) Formal solution of the system yields

If a + 1 * 0 and a - 1 * 0, then the system has the single solution 

_ a 2 + a + 1 


* = ITT ■ 

If a = -i, or if a = +1, then the formulas are meaningless; in the 
first instance we arrive at the system 


f-x + y = 1 , 
l x-y = 1 , 


which is a contradictory system. In the second instance we have 

ix + y = 1 , 

\x + y = 1 , 

which has an infinite number of solutions (for example, for x arbit 
rary, y = 1 — x).

Here, if a 2 — 1 =£ 0, the system has the single solution x = a 2 + 1, 
y = ~ a - For a = — 1 and a - 1, we obtain the systems 

j-* + y = -l, 

*■ X — y = 1 

and 

(x + y = 1 , 

\x + y = l, 

both of which have an infinite number of solutions. 

(c) We obtain from the first two equations 

y + 2 = 1 — ax 

and 

ay + z = a — x . 

If we consider this as a system of two equations in two unknowns 
y and z , we obtain 



Hence, if a * 1, then y = 1 + * and * = -(1 + a )x. If these values 
are substituted into the third equation, we find 

x -I- (1 + x) —a( 1 -f- a)x = a 2 , 

x(2 -a- a 2 ) = a 2 - 1 
—x(a + 2)(a — 1 ) = a 2 — 1 . 

Therefore, if a — 1 ^0 and a + 2 + 0 , the system has the single 
solution

For — 1 and # — — 2 , we obtain the systems 


Solutions (175)

* + y + z = 1 


279 


and 

— 2 jc + y + z = 1 , 
x — 2 _y + 2 = — 2 , 
x + y — 22 = 4 , 

The first of these systems has an infinite number of solutions, and 
the second has no solution (from the first two equations we obtain 
—x — y + 2 z — — 1 , which is inconsistent with the third equation). 

175. If we subtract the second equation from the first, and the 
sixth from the fifth, and equate the two expressions for x 2 — x 3 , we 
obtain 

ct\(ctz — afs) = ct 4 (ct 2 — a 3 ) , 
or, 

(ct i — ct 4 )(a 2 — a 3 ) = 0 . 

Similarly, if we obtain the two expressions related by Xi — x 2 and 
also by x { — x 3 , we find two more relationships: 

(tfi — a 2 ) (or* — flf 4 ) = 0 , 

(oci — a 3 )(a 2 — a 4 ) = 0 . 

The first of these three relationships implies that either oci = a 4 
or a 2 = a 3 (possibly both). Let us suppose that a 2 = u 3 = ol . Then, 
from the second relationship, = a or else a 4 = a. Either of these 
possibilities makes the third equation an identity. Hence, for the 
system to be consistent, it is necessary that three of the four quanti¬ 
ties u u a 2 , a 3 , ct 4 be equal. 

Suppose now that ct v = ct 2 — u 3 = a and that u 4 = 0. Recalling 
those expressions for the differences x x — x 2r x k — x 3 , x 2 — x 3 , with 
the aid of which we obtained the relationships just exploited between 
a lt a 2 ,ot 3i and a 4t we find that 

Xi = x 2 — x 3 . 

Designating Xi = x 2 = x 3 by x, and x 4 by y, we find that the six 
equations in four unknowns reduces to two equations in two un¬ 
knowns: 


2x = a 2 , 
x + y = a0 ,

in the following two cases:

176. From the first of the given equations, 

x — 2 — y. 

Upon substitution into the second, we obtain 

2y-y* -z 2 = 1 , 
or 

2 2 + y‘ - 2y + 1 = 0 , 
or 

2 2 + (y - l) 2 = 0 . 

Each of the two terms of the last equation is nonnegative, hence 
both must vanish. Hence 2 = 0 and y = 1 , which implies x = 1 . 
Therefore, the system has precisely one real solution. 

177. (a) First we note that if x 0 is a root of the given equation, 
then — Xq is also a root. Consequently, there are as many negative 
roots as there are positive roots. Moreover, the number 0 is clearly 
a root of the equation. It suffices then to find how many positive 

roots there are. Now if = sin x, then 


■v 


Solutions ( 176-177) 281 

| x | = 100 | sin * | ^ 100-1 = 100 , 

and so no root can exceed 100 in absolute value. 

Let us partition the x-axis from 0 to 100 into segments each of 
length 2/7 (except for the final segment, which will be shorter); we 
shall examine each interval separately to find the roots in it. (See 
Figure 12 ). 



Figure 12 

There exists one positive root in the interval from 0 to 2/7; in 
each of the following intervals (excluding the final one) there 
are two positive roots. To find how many roots may be contri¬ 
buted by the final interval, we examine it separately. Now, is 
a number between 15 and 16 = 6.666 * • • > 27r;-^= 6.25 <2/7^ ; 

consequently, we have 15 segments each of length 2/7 and one final 
segment of length 100 —15-2/7 > 5 > /7. This final segment is long 
enough to contain the complete upper half of the sinusoidal period, 
and hence it also contributes two roots. 

Therefore, in all we have 1 + 14*2 -f 2 = 31 positive roots for the 
given equation, an equal number of negative roots, and, in addition, 
the root 0; therefore, the equation has 63 roots. 

(b) The solution is quite similar to that of problem (a). First, 
if sin x = log x, then x ^ 10 (inasmuch as sin x ^ 1). Since 2 -2k >10, 
the interval on the x-axis between x = 0 and x = 10 contains one 
complete period of the sine curve plus part of a second period. The

graph of log x intersects the first wave of the sine curve at pre¬ 
cisely one point (see Figure 13). Further, since 2/7 + — < 10, then 
5/7 

at the point x = we have sin x = 1 > log x, which means that 

the graph of log x intersects the first half of the second positive wave 
of sin x. Since, at x = 10, log x = 1 > sin x> the graph of log x must 
intersect this second wave another time. Therefore, we conclude 
that the equation sin x = log x has exactly three real roots. 

178. It is readily verified that the proposition of the problem is 
valid for n = 1 and n = 2: 

Xi + x 2 = 6 

x\ + x\ — (xi + x 2 ) 2 — 2x x x 2 = 6 2 — 2-1 = 34 . 

(The sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is equal to the negative 
of the coefficient of x). 

Further, we have 

X\ + X 2 — (aTi + X 2 )(X\ 1 + X 2 l ) XiX 2 (x* 2 + ATa 2 ) 

= 6wr l + *r l ) - l-wr* + *r 2 ). 

or 

+ *? = 5 ur l + *r l ) 

+ tur 1 + *r l ) - (*r 2 + xr 2 )] ( 1 ) 

It follows from this formula, first, that if jtf _3 + xl" 2 and x*~ l + xj“ l 
are integers, then Xi + xl is also an integer; thus, by mathematical 
induction x* + x\ is shown to be an integer for all natural numbers 
n. 

Now, let n be the least positive integer such that Xi + x 2 is divi¬ 
sible by 5. It follows from (1) that, in this case, the difference 

wr 1 + *r ! ) - (xr 2 + *r 2 ) 

is also divisible by 5. But if we replace n in (1) by n — 1, we obtain 

tf- 1 + xr 1 = 5(*r 2 + xr 2 ) 

+ (xr 2 + xr 2 ) - (.xr 3 + xr 3 ), 

from which it follows that 

^n-3 + x n-i = 5(x n-2 + ^ 

- [(xr l + xr 1 ) - (xr 2 + xr 2 )] 


Solutions (179-180) 


283 


is also divisible by 5. This contradicts the assumption that n is the 
least integer such that x? + xT is divisible by 5. Hence we mus I con ^ 
elude that there cannot exist a positive integer n such that x\ + x 2 
is divisible by 5. 

179. Let us say that there are n positive numbers (and hence 
1000 — n negative numbers) among the numbers au & 2 >' * *>#iooo. Then, 
in the expansion given, the “mixed products'' aiaj of the n positive 

numbers j^there will be n ^ n of these products J and the mixed 
products of the 1000 - n negative numbers [there will be 

(1000- n) (1000 - » - 1) 

2 


of these products] will be positive terms, and the product of positive 
by negative numbers [there will be w(1000 — n) of these] will be 
negative. The condition of the problem requires that 

n( ~ n - ^ , (1000 - m)(1000 - n -,11 _ n ( 10 00 - n) ,

which is impossible. 

For the analogous problem posed, we obtain by similar reasoning 
the requirement 

10,000 ± V 10,000" _ 10,000 ± 100 
n = — - 2 - 2 


Here it is possible for the expansion to contain an equal number of 
positive and negative mixed products. For this, it suffices if the 

initial polynomial contains 10>000^+ 100 _ c^q positive numbers and 
10,000^— 100 _ 4950 ne g a tive numbers (or vice-versa). 

180. First, we have 


(V 2 - l) 1 = l/ 2 - 1 ; 

(l/T - l) 2 = 3 - 2V~2 = VT ~ • 






284 


Miscellaneous Problems in Algebra 


The proof will proceed by mathematical induction. Assume that 

(l/T - l)»-« = BVT -A = V2B 2 - VW 

can be put into the form VW - VN- 1, that is, that 25 2 - A 2 = l. 
We shall show that (replacing k by k + 1) 

(l/T - l) 2 *+> = B'VT - A' 

also comes into such a form, that is, that 25' 2 - A' 2 = 1 We can 
write 

0/T - i) 2 *+> = (i/T - l) 2 

= (5i/T - A) (3 - 2t/T) 

= (35 + 2A)VT - (45 + 3A) ; 

consequently, 

5' = 35 + 2A , 

A' = 45 + 3A , 

and 

2 B’ 2 - A' 2 = 2(35 + 2A) 2 - (45 + 3A) 2 

= 185 2 + 24A5 + 8A 2 - 165 2 - 24A5 - 9A 2 
= 25 2 — A 2 = 1 , 
which is what we wished to show. 

Therefore if the number (VT - 1) 2 ‘ = C - DVT can be put into 
the form J /N 1 /jV— 1, then also the number ( 1 /2 — 1) 2 * +2 = 
C' — D'V 2 can be expressed in this form. 

The assertion of the problem follows by mathematical induction. 

181. If (A + 5 V 3 ) 2 = C + DV 3 , then C = A 2 + 35 2 D = 2A5 

(A - BV T) 2 = A 2 + 35 2 - 2A51/T = C- DV T . 
Consequently, if 

(A + 5]/T) 2 = 99,999 + 111,111 VT , 

then also 

(A - 5i/T) 2 = 99,999 - 111,111 VT , 

which is an impossibility inasmuch as the left member of this equa¬ 
tion is positive and the right member is negative. 

182. Assume that = fi + qVT (p, q, and r rational). If both 
sides are cubed, we obtain 


Solutions ( 182-183 ) 


285 


2 = p 2 + 3, p 2 qV r + 3 pq 2 r + q 2 rV r , 
or, 

2 = P(P 2 + 3 q 2 r) -f q(3p 2 -f q 2 r) l/ r . 

We shall now show that our assumption that V 2 = p + qV* r 
implies that V 2 is a rational number. First, if q = 0, then V~2 = 
p is rational. If q 0 and if 3 p 2 + q 2 r *= 0, then from the last of 
the above equations we obtain 


from which we find 




2 - p(p 2 + 3 q 2 r) 
q(3p z + q 2 r) 



V 2 = p + q 


2 - p(p l + 3 q 2 r) 


" " “ K r * q(3p z + q z r) 9 
which states that V~2 is rational. If 3 p 2 + q 2 r = 0, then 


q'r = -3 P 2 , 

2 = />[/>’+ 3(-3/> 2 )] = -8/>\ 


and V 2 = —2 p is again a rational number. 

It remains to prove that V 2 is not a rational number. If V~2 

were equal to an irreducible fraction — then we would have 2 = 
tn 2 ^ 

——, or m 2 = 2 n 2 . In this event m 2 (and hence m) would have to be 
n 2 

an even number, and therefore would be divisible by 8. We could 
m 2 yyi 2 

then write n 2 = ——, and, since--— is even, then necessarily n 2 (and 

u dt 

therefore n) would have to be even. This contradicts the assump¬ 
tion that — is irreducible, and the contradiction proves the statement 
n 


of the problem. 


183. (a) Designate 1.00000000004 by ac f and 1.00000000002 by g. 
Then it is readily seen that the two numbers of the problem can be

(X — a) 2 — (x — a) 2 . We note that 

(X - a) 2 -(x- a) 2 = X 2 - x 2 - 2a(X - x ). 

We can now write the difference 

[(X - a,)* + (X - a t ) 2 +■■•+(*- a,)*]

= 2 (dz — dx)(a 2 — a 4 ) < 0 , 

Consequently, the arrangement we seek is 

d\y doj d 4 , dz . 

(b) First Solution . Consider the expression

where di r di 2> are the given numbers in the required order. 

Consider two of these numbers a i(t and where a < /3. We claim 
that if di a is greater than (or, respectively, less than) then 
is greater than (or, respectively, less than) «i j8+1 . (We assume 
^). 

If we assumed the contrary, that is, if 

(«ic ~ < 0 » 

then the permutation which reverses the order di oc+lf d\ a+2 , * • *, «^ 
would decrease the value of the sum 0, since the difference of the 
new sum 0 / and the initial sum 0 would then be 

0' — 0 — 2di a _ l dip 2Gi a dip +l + + 2 GipGifl + 

= 2(d ia - ~ «ip + 1 ) • 

This observation enables us to find the full solution of the problem. 
First, since a cyclic permutation of all the given numbers (the permu¬ 
tation which preserves the relative positions of the numbers—for 
example, writing them in a circle and merely rotating the circle) 
does not change the value of 0, we can assume that a il is the smallest 
of the numbers, that is, i v = 1. It is then possible to assume that 



288

a> 2 and a Xn follow in order of magnitude. In fact, if for example, 
a 'P < a n (0 ^ w )» then we w °uld have (.— ai p+l ) < 0 , and 
if a ifi < a in (0 =*= 2 ), then we would have (a^ — to^iton — flip) < 0 . 
Since it is possible to change the order of the "links” of the chain 
a^, di v * • •, to n , ai v to the reversed order without changing the 
value of 0, we can assume that #t 2 < ai n , i% = 2, and z n = 3. 

Further, we assert that the numbers ai 3 ,ai n _ 1 follow in this order 
in magnitude, within the pattern of the numbers a^,^, #; n already 
considered. In fact, if, for example, a» s > (0 =£ 1, 2; n — 1, «), 

then we would have (a » 3 — top)(to 2 — a< p+l ) < 0. But since we have, 
moreover, (a^ — ton-fan “ it follows that a < 3 < that 

is, a iz = <z 4 and ai n _ 1 = a 5 . 

It is similarly shown that a * 4 and a tn _ 3 follow in magnitude after 
< a i n -2 (** = 6 , z "-2 — 7), that the numbers a * 5 and #,- n _ 3 follow in 
magnitude after the previously determined a ,* 5 < a * n _ 3 (z 5 = 8 , z n - 3 = 9), 
and so on. Finally, we can set down the following scheme. 

If n = 2k (even), then

even n we have the order a u a 2} a i} a 6 , * • •, # n - 2 , a nj a n - 1 , * • •, a lt a if a 2 ). 

Second Solution . If the order obtained in the first solution could, 
in some manner, have been guessed at, the verification could be 
made by mathematical induction. In fact, for n — 4 the proof is 
quite simple [see the solution of problem (a)]. Assume now that for 
some even n the sum 0 n in the arrangement given by part (a) for 
the numbers a x < a 2 < - ■ • < a n is less than the sum corresponding 
to any other order. We shall prove that the sum 0 „-u corresponding 
to the scheme shown in part ( a ), as it concerns the n + 1 numbers 
a x < a 2 < ■ • ■ < a n < a n + i, is less than the sum^i+i corresponding to 
any other ordering of the n + 1 numbers. We have

On the other hand, if in the order answering to a sum®» + , the 
number a.+, were to stand between two numbers a* and ap, and if 
<Dn answers the array of n numbers obtained from the array of n + 1 
numbers leading to a sum®»+i by striking out the number a n + 1 , then

out in a similar manner for odd n. 

Third Solution. This problem has a less involved geometrical so¬ 
lution. We represent the numbers at < a 2 < a 3 < ■ ■ ■ < a„ by points 
A A, A, ■■■ An on a number axis; we designate the intervals 

IX, -42-43, • --jAn-iAn, respecti^vely, by d u d 2 , • ■ •, d n -i- Then the 
sum

is equal to the sum of the squares of interval lengths, or “links”

position (once in the direction from Ak to A k +i and again in the 
reverse direction). Therefore, regardless of the order in which we 
take the points, the expanded sum 0 when expressed in terms of the 
lengths d lt d 2 , ■ • - t d n ^i must contain all the numbers^; that is, 
2d\ t 2d\, • • ■, 2dl~i. Further, let A k -iA k = d k -\ and A k A k +1 = d k be 
two adjacent segments. It is clear that if the link of the overlying 
curve which covers the segment A k A k+l going from A k to A k+l 
commences at the point A kj then the link covering this segment in 
the reverse direction cannot terminate at the point A k . Therefore, 
in all cases there must exist a link which simultaneously covers the 
segments A k -iA k and A k A k +i. It follows that the sum 0 must in all 
cases contain all the numbers 2d k -id kt that is, 2did 2f 2d 2 d 2f ’ ■ *, 2d n -zd n -i. 

Now we need only note that if the points are ordered as in the 
first solution of this problem, then 

0 = 2d\ + 2d\ + • • * + 2d\~\ + 2d\d 2 + 2d 2 d$ + • * • + 2d n - 2 d n ~i 

[see Figure 14 (b)]. It follows from this, and from what has been 
said above, that the sum 0 will be least for this ordering. 

186. (a) First, we may assume that the numbers a u a 2 , ••*,«« 
and b lf b 2 , are all positive, since if some of them are negative 

it is clear that the inequality will be exaggerated. Consider the 
broken line A 0 AiA 2 * • ■ A n in Figure 15, where the lengths of the

projections of the segments A Q A U AiA 2 * • *, A n -iA n onto the *-axis 
are denoted by a u a 2 , * * ■, a n , and onto the y-axis by b u b 2j • • *, 
Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we see that

The broken line AoAzA* ■■■ A n can be equal in length to the seg¬

only if «!- _ = ... = and then we have the equality. 

(b) Let h be the height of the pyramid; let a u au ■ ■ ■, a» be 
the lengths of the sides of the base (a, + a 2 + ■■■ +a n = P, the base 
perimeter); and let b u b*, be the lengths of the perpendicu¬

for a right pyramid) to each of the base sides, respectively, 
(then + \ajn + ■ • ■ + = S, the base area). Now, the 

lateral surface area 1 of the pyramid is equal to

The statement of the problem follows immediately.

even and n is odd.

broken line B X B% B n + 1 . By the Pythagorean theorem,

It is obvious that the length of the broken line B X B% ••• B n+i is

This proves the inequality sought. 

It is not difficult now to determine when the equality holds. In 
order to arrive at the equalit y, all the points B t ,B*,y,B. must 
lie on the line segment B { B n+ 1 (that is, Bi mu st c oincide^ with the 
points of intersection of the line segments B t Bn + i and AiA i+x . Beca use

188. First Solution. Both numbers of the inequality are positive; 
hence upon squaring both sides we have 


1 - x\ + 1 - xl + 2 V(1 - *?)(i _ xf) ^ 4 - (^ + 2x lXi + x\) 


that is, 


21/(1-*?X1-^) ^ 2 - 2xiX 2 ,

If again we square both sides, we have 

— x\ — x\ + x\x\ ^ 1 — 2XiX 2 -f x\x \, 
and if all terms are transposed to the right side, we have 

0 ^ (x l - x 2 ) 2 . 

It is clear that the right member of the given inequality dominates 
the left member; also, the equality can hold only for x { = x 2 . 

Second Solution. This problem can also be solved by geometric 
means; analogous solutions are possible for many more involved 
problems of this sort. Consider in the Cartesian coordinate system 
(plane) the unit circle with center at the origin (Figure 17). The 
coordinates *, y of points on the circle are related by the equation 

* 2 + y = i. a) 

Select two points Mi and M 2 on the *-axis having absicissas x y 
and x 2 and where \xi\ fk 1 and | x 2 1 ^ 1 (thus both points are within 
or else on the circle). Construct perpendiculars from M, and M z 
intersecting the upper semicircle in the points N, and N it respectively. 
It js clear from equation (1) that M,N, = Vl-x\ and M 2 A^ 2 = 


Solutions (188)

Figure 17 


Note now that the absicissa — - 2 will be the midpoint of the 

segment M V M 2 J We shall designate this point on the *-axis by M, 
and the point above it on the circle by N, _ 

Clearly, the length of MN is -j/1 — ^ . Now, the sum 

MiNi + M 2 N 2 is equal to twice the length of the segment MN *, 
where N* is the point of the trapezoid M l N l N 2 M 2 just above M, and 
MN* is obviously shorter than MN. The inequality of the problem 
follows immediately. The equality holds only if the points M x and 
M% coincide, that is, if x Y ~ x 2 . 

Remark : Many interesting inequalities are suggested by this last proof. 
For example, consider the unit sphere with center at the origin (Figure 18). 
Let Mi and Mi be any two points in the XT-plane within (or on) the sphere, 
and let Ni and N 2 be the points of intersection, with the sphere, of perpen¬ 
diculars to the plane rising from Afi and Af 2 , respectively. Let M be the 
midpoint of segment MiMi, and construct the perpendicular MN in the plane 
containing Afi, Mi , Nu and Ni, where N is the intersection with the sphere. 
Obviously, MN will intersect the segment from Ni to AT 2 , and this intersection 
point we label N r . If (xi,yi) and (x 2t yi) are the coordinates of points Mi and 
Mi, then 

f This is obvious for positive Xi and x 2 \ it is easily verified that this will 
hold even if one of the numbers is (or both are) negative. Also, it suffices to 
consider only positive xi and x 2f since in any other event the inequality is 
emphasized.

MzN 2 = Vi - - i/, 2 ; 


MiV = 


/■ - (-afs-) 1 - 


=-(MiM + M 2 M) 
And since MN f £ MN, it follows that 




provided, however, that all the expressions under the radical are nonnegative. 
Equality here will hold only for x\ = xi , y\ — y z , that is, only when points Mi 
and Mz are coincident. 



Figure 18 Figure 19 

A somewhat similar inequality can be produced by using a triangle MiM z Mz 
in the XY- plane and letting M be the point of intersection of the medians of 
the triangle (Figure 19). We obtain the inequality

This results from the fact that segment MN f of the perpendicular from M 
does not exceed segment MN. Inequality (3) is valid only when the expres¬ 
sions under the radicals are nonnegative; the equality holds only for x\ = X 2 = 
xz and y^ — yz — y 3 ; that is, when the points Mi, M 3 all coincide. 

Another inequality arises from the use of a right circular cone having its 
vertex at the origin and the s-axis as its central axis, and having a vertex 
angle of 90° (Figure 20): 

V x\ + v\ + V x\ + y\ + V x\ + y\ 



Xi 

This is valid for all xi, Xi, £3 and y 1 , y%, y$. Equality holds only when — = 

Vi 

— = —, that is, when Ni, Ni, and N z lie simultaneously on a generator of 
V2 y$ 

the cone. Algebraic proofs for inequalities (2), ( S ), and {U) are very involved.

Replacing * by * 4 - in the last sum obtained, and adding the

Finally, in another step, we find that cos 32* can take on only posi¬ 
tive values for all *. But this is a contradiction, since if * = , 

then cos 32* = cos k— — 1 . This contradiction proves the assertion 
of the problem.

where A 0 , A lf A 2f •*•,>!„ are the coefficients whose sum we wish to 
find, and the degree n of this polynomial is 743-2 + 744*2 = 2974. 
In equation (1) let x = 1 ; we then have

The sum we seek is equal to 1. 


197. Assume that we have expanded the two expressions, obtaining 
two polynomials in x. Now let us replace x by —x in each poly¬ 
nomial and rewrite them: the coefficients of odd powers of x change 
sign, and the coefficients of even powers do not. In particular, the 
coefficient of a 20 in each of the expansions remains unchanged. 
Hence, insofar as the coefficient of a 20 is concerned, we may as well 
compare the coefficients of a 20 in the two expressions (1 -f a 2 + a 3 ) 1000 
and (1 — a 2 — a 3 ) 1000 , which are obtained, respectively, from the given 
expressions, by replacing a by —a. 

Now it is easily shown that the first of these new polynomials has 
the larger coefficient for a 20 . In fact, the expansion of (1 ■+- a 2 + a 3 ) 1000 
contributes only positive terms to the sum which makes up the 
coefficient of a 20 ; the expansion of (1 — a 2 — a 3 ) 1000 cannot produce as

The Algebra of Polynomials 



large a coefficient for x 20 , since the sum making up that coefficient 
is comprised of like terms having coefficients of the same absolute 
values as those of the first expansion, but some of them are negative. 

Therefore, the coefficient of x 20 in (1 + x 2 — x 3 ) 1000 is greater than 
that in (1 — x 2 + a; 3 ) 1000 .

201. (a) First solution . Since x* — 1 is divisible by * — 1, for all 
natural numbers &, and since we can write 

X + X 3 + X 9 + X 27 + x 81 + x 243 = (x — 1) + (* 3 — 1) 

+ ( X 9 - 1) + (x 27 - 1) + (x» L - 1) + (* 243 - 1) + 6 , 

we see that the given polynomial gives a remainder of 6 upon di¬ 
vision by x — 1. 

Second Solution . Let q(x) be the quotient resulting from division 
of the given polynomial by jr — 1, and let r be the remainder. Then 

x + x 3 + x 9 + * 27 + x ai + x 243 = q(x)(x - 1) + r . 

The substitution x ~ 1 into this identity yields r = 6. 

(b) Let q(x) be the quotient and let r x x + r 2 be the remainder 
obtained by dividing the given polynomial by x 2 — 1. Then 


* + *3 + + x 27 + x 81 + x 243 = q(x)(x 2 - 1) + nx + r 2 . 

If we substitute, first, x = 1 into this identity, and then x = — 1, we 
derive the two equations (both of which must hold): 

6 = r l + r 2 

and 

—6 = —r l + r 2 . 

Solution of this system yields r x = 6 and r 2 = 0. 

Therefore, the remainder we seek is 6x. 

202. Designate the unknown polynomial by p(x), and let q(x) desig¬ 
nate the quotient and r(x) = ax + b the remainder resulting from 
division P(x) by (x — 1)(* — 2). Then 

P(x) = (* - l)(x - 2 )q(x) + ax + b . (I) 

By the conditions of the problem, 

P(x) = (* - DqM + 2 , 

whence p( 1) = 2; ** 

p(x) = (x - 2 )q 2 (x) + 1 , 

whence p( 2) = 1. 

If we substitute x = 1 and * = 2, successively, in (I), we obtain 
the two equations 

2 = p(l) = a + b , 

and 

1 = p(2) — 2a + b , 

from which we obtain 

a = — 1 , 

6 = 3. 

Therefore, the remainder sought is — x + 3. 

203. The polynomial x 4 + * 3 + 2* 2 + x- + 1 is factorable into 
(x 2 + l)(x 2 + x + 1). It follows that this polynomial is a divisor of 

x 12 - 1 = (* 6 - IX* 6 + 1) 

- (x 3 - IX* 3 + 1)(* 2 + 1)(* 4 - * 2 + 1) ,

even powers by the difference of the bases). It follows that the

This equation satisfies the condition of the problem.

x = i/ 2 + ^3,

Two of the three irrational numbers can be readily eliminated 
from these three equations, namely, i/ 2, %/ 3, and V 9, by finding 
Uieir corresponding expressions in terms of x, x 2 , and x 3 . In fact, 
from the first and second equations we obtain

ffi=x 2 -2-2v r 2- ^3" 

= * 2 - 2 - 2i/ir(* - t/ 2 - ) = JC 2 + 2 — 2i/"2x. 

If these substitutions are made in the third equation, we obtain 
jc 3 = 2i/T + 6(jc - l/2) + 3-i/2"(^ 2 + 2 - 2i/2i) + 3 , 
from which we find 

x 3 + 6x — 3 = i/"2"(3x 2 + 2) . 

% 

Now we may eliminate the radical by squaring and transposing all 
terms to the left side: 

x e + 36x 2 + 9 + 12x 4 - 6x 3 - 36x = 18x 4 + 24x 2 + 8 ; 

_ 6* 4 - 6x 3 + 12x 2 - 36* + 1 = 0 . 

This equation satisfies the condition of the problem.

Second Solution. Using the results of problem 206, we can assert 
that the necessary and sufficient condition for the given equations 
to have a common root is the vanishing of the following expression: 

# 2 + 1 - a ■ l(a + 1) + a 2 - 2a = a 2 - 3a + 2 

= (a - 1 ){a 2 + a - 2) = (a - \)\a + 2) .

208. Let (x — fl)(x — 10) -F 1 = (x -F b){x -F c). If we make the sub¬ 
stitution x = —b in this identity we obtain 

(-ft - a){~b - 10) + 1 = (-ft + ftX-ft + c) = 0 . 

Thus, necessarily, 

(ft + a){b + 10) = -1 . 

Since a and ft are to be integers, ft -F a and ft -f 10 must also be 
integers. However, —1 can be the product of two integers only if 
one of the integers is +1 and the other is —1. Therefore, there 
are only two possibilities: 

(1) ft + 10 = 1, ft = —9; then ft + a = —9 + a — —1, that is, a — 8. 
In this case, 

(x - 8)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - 9) 2 . 

(2) ft + 10 = —1, ft = —11; then ft + a = —11 + a = 1, that is, a = 
12. In this case, 

{x- 12)(x - 10) + 1 = (x - ll) 2 . 

209. A polynomial of degree four can be represented as a product

For the first case we have 

x(x — a)(x — b){x — c) + 1 = (x + p){x 3 + qx 2 + rx + s) . (I) 

[The coefficient of x in the first factor on the right side and of x 3 
in the second factor are both either 1 or —1, since the coefficient of 
x 4 on the left is 1. However, the equation x(x — a)(x — b){x — c) -F 1 = 
(—* + />i)(—x 3 -F qiX 2 + r v x -F s : ) can be written in form (I) by using 
— 1 as a factor on both sides.] 

If in identity (i) we substitute, in turn, * = 0, x — a, x = ft, and 
x = c t and note that 1 can be expressed as the product of two factors 
in only two ways, 1 = 1*1 or 1 = (—1)-(—1), we see that the four 
distinct numbers

a + P , 

b + p y 

c + p 

(distinct since, by hypothesis, a, b, and c are distinct) can have only 
two values, +1 or —1. This is a contradiction. 

For the second case we have 

x(x — a)(x — b){x — c) + 1 = (x 2 + px + q)(x 2 + rx + s) . 

Substituting, successively, x = 0, x = a, x = b, and x = c, we find 
that both the polynomials x 2 + px + q and x 2 + rx + 5 can take on 
only values of +1 or —1. Now, the quadratic trinomial x 2 + px + q 
cannot have the same value a for three distinct values of x (other¬ 
wise the quadradic equation x 2 + px + q — a = 0 would have three 
distinct roots), and so for two of the four distinct values x — 0, x = a, 
x = b y and x = c this trinomial has value 1, and for the other two 
it has value —1. Supppse that 0 2 + p- 0 + q = q = l, and let x = a 
be the other value among the numbers x = a, x = b, and x = c for 
which this trinomial has value 1. Then for x = b and for x = c this 
trinomial has value — 1. This yields the equations 

a 2 + pa + 1 = 1 , 
b 2 + pb + 1 = -1 , 
c 2 + pc + 1 = -1 . 

From a 2 + pa = a(a + p) = 0 we find that a + p — 0 and p = —a 
(by hypothesis a =£ 0). Then the last two equations take on the form 

b 2 — ab — b(b - a) = -2 , 
c 2 — ac = c(c — a) = —2 . 

If we subtract the first equation from the second, we obtain 

b 2 — ab — c 2 + ac = (b — c)(b + c) — a(b — c) 

= (b — c)(b + c — a) = 0 , 

b + c — a — 0 , 
a = b + c , 
b — a = —c , 
c — a — —b . 


which yields (since b =£ c) 


Solutions (209) 

Now, from the equation 


315 


b(b - a) = -be = -2 

we find the following values for b, c , and a: 

6 = 1 , 

c = 2, 

a = b + c = 3 , 

x(.r — a)(x — 6)(x — c) + 1 = x(x — 3)(x — 1)(* — 2) + 1 

= (* 2 - 3* + l) 2 , 

and 

b =-1 , 
c= -2, 

a = b + c = —3 , 

x(x - a)(x - b)(x - c) + l=x(x + 3)(* + l)(x + 2) + 1 

= (* 2 - 3* + l) 2 . 

Analogously, if * 2 + px + q assumes the value -1 for * = 0 and 
x — a y and hence the value +1 for x = b and x == c t we have 

Q — —1 , 

a 2 + pa — 1 = — 1 , 
b 2 + pc — 1 = 1, 
c 2 + pc — 1 = 1, 

from which we obtain 

p = —a , a = b + c , 

b(b - a) = c(c - a) = 2 , b - a = -c 9 
b 2 — ab — c 2 + ac = 0 , —be — 2 . 

(6 — c)(^ + c — c) = 0 , 

In this way we obtain two additional systems from which to obtain 
values for a t b t and c: 

b = 2, 
c - — 1 , 
a — b + c = 1 ,

Remark : Another solution of this problem is given in the final part of the 
solution of problem 210 (b). 

210. (a) Assume that 

(x - a x )(x - a 2 )(x — a 2 ) • ■ * (x - a n ) - 1 = p(x)q(x) , 

where p(x) and q(x) are both polynomials of degree ^ 1 with integral 
coefficients, and that the sum of their degrees is n. We may assume 
that the leading coefficient in each polynomial is 1 (compare with 
the preceding problem). If we make the successive substitutions 
x = a u x — a 2 , x = a 2 , • ■ x — a n , and take into consideration that —1 
is essentially factorable only as —1 = 1 - (—1), we see that, for each 
of these values of x, either p(x) = 1 and q(x) = — 1, or vice-versa. 
Therefore, the sum p(x) + q(x) vanishes for x = a lr a 2 , * ■ *, a n , and the 
equation p(x) + q(x) = 0 has as its roots Xi = a u x 2 = a 2 , ■ * •, x n = a n . 
It follows that p(x) + q(x) is divisible by x — a x x — a 2t • ■ •, x — a n , 
and hence by the product ( x — a x )(x — a 2 ) • ■ * (x — a n ). However, the 
degree of the polynomial p(x) + q(x) is only the larger of the degrees 
of p(x) or q(x), which is less than n [n is the degree of ( x — a x )(x — a 2 ) 
• • • (x — a n ) — 1]. Therefore, p(x) + q(x) cannot be divisible by the 
product (x — a x )(x — a 2 ) ■ * ■ (x — a n ), and because of this contradiction 
we must conclude that the factorization assumed at the beginning of 
this proof is not possible. 

(b) Assume that 

(x - a v )(x - a 2 )(x - a 2 ) * * • (x - a n ) - 1 = p(x)q(x) , 

where p(x) and q(x) are polynomials of degree ^ 1, and whose leading 
coefficients are each 1. If in this identity we substitute, successively, 
x — a u x — a 2 , x = a 3 , • ■ •, x = a n , then we find that for each of these 
values of x , p(x) = 1, q(x) = 1, or else p(x) — — 1, q(x) = — 1. 

Since p(x) — q(x) vanishes for n distinct values of x, we must con¬ 
clude that p(x) — q(x) = 0, or p(x) = q(x) [compare with fhe solution 
of problem (a)]; also, the integer n must be even, say n = 2k, where 
k is the common degree of the identical polynomials p(x) and q(x). 
We can rewrite the identity in the form

Hi,

Now f the product of the two polynomials p(x) + 1 and p(x) - 1 
%niiish%es for x = a u x = a 2 , ■ x = # 2 *. Consequently, for each of 
Ihcse -values of x at least one of these polynomials vanishes, which 
inrans that either p(x) + 1 or else p(x) - 1 (or both) is divisible by 
i and this conclusion holds also for divisibility by * — a 2 x - a 2 , 

ii.net sqd on. Since a polynomial of degree k cannot be divisible by 
Ihe Product of more than k factors of form x - a it and since the 
polynomial p(x) + 1 of degree k, with leading coefficient 1, is divisi¬ 
ble tny k factors of form it follows that this polynomial is 

identically equal to this product. That is, p(x) + 1 is the product 

of k of the factors x - a u x - a 2f x - a 2k , and p(x) - 1 is the 

product of the remaining k factors. 

We may assume, with generality, that 

p(x) + 1 = (* — <h)(x — As) • • ' (* — * 2 fc-i) » 

p(x) - 1 = (x — a 2 )(x - a A ) * • • (x - a 2k ) . 

If the second equation is subtracted from the first, we obtain 
2 = (* - a x )(x - a.) ■ ■ ■ (x - a u -i) - (x - a 2 )(x - a<) • ■ ■ (x - a 2k ) . 

Now, to consider a specific case, if we let x = a 2y we obtain the 
factorization of the integer 2 as the product of k integral factors: 

2 = (a 2 — a x )(a 2 — a*) * • ■ (a 2 — a 2k ~\) . ^) 

Since the integer 2 cannot be expressed as a product of more than 
three distinct integers [for example, 2 = 1 ■ (-1) ■ (-2)] it follows that 
k ^ 3. But the condition k = 3 is impossible in (i). Assume, for ex¬ 
ample, that& = 3 and that a x < a 2 < a b ; then 2 = (a 2 — a x )(a 2 — a 2 )(a 2 — a*), 
where a 2 -a x > a 2 -a 2 > a 2 -a b , and hence a 2 - a, = 1, 
and a 2 - a*= -2. If we substitute x = a, in the formula 

2 = (x — a x )(x — a 2 )(x — a b ) — (x — a 2 )(x — a<)(x — a 6 ) , 
we arrive at the other representation of the integer 2 as a product 
of three “polynomials”: 

2 = (a 4 — ai)(a 4 — a 2 )(a 4 — aC) , 

where also a 4 — a x > a 4 — a 2 > a 4 — a b . It follows that a 4 a x — 1, 
a 4 ~~ a% = -1, and a A - = -2, which implies that = &*, which 



318 


The Algebra of Polynomials 


contradicts the conditions of the problem. 

Hence only two cases are possible: k — 2 and k = 1. 

If k = 1, we have 

2 = (x - a v ) - (x - a 2 ) , 

which implies that a 2 — a x + 2, and if we designate a 2 simply by a , 
we have 

(x — a x )(x — a 2 ) + 1 = (* — a)(jc — a — 2) + 1 
= (x — a — l) z 

(compare with the solution of problem 208). 

If k — 2, we have 

2 = (x — a x )(x — a z ) - (x - a 2 )(x - a 4 ) , 

where we will consider a x < c 3 and a 2 < a 4 . If we substitute x = a 2 
in this equation, and then substitute x = a iT (thus obtaining two 
equations) we have 

2 = (a 2 — fli)(fl 2 — a 3 ) , a 2 — fli > — a 3 , 

2 = (fl 4 — ~ a®) , a K — a x > a A — a 3 . 

However, the integer 2 can be expressed (in diminishing order) 
only in two ways: 2 = 2*1 and 2 = (—1) * (—2). Since, moreover, 
a 2 — a x < a 4 — a u we obtain 

a 2 — a x — —1 , a 2 — a* — — 2 , 
a K — a x — 2 , — c 3 = 1 , 

from which, replacing a x by a , we find 

a 2 = — 1 , 

fia = a + 1 , 
a^ = a + 2 , 

and 

(* “ fli)U - a 2 )(x - fl s )(jc - a 4 ) + 1

(see the solution of problem 209).

Solutions (211)

where p(x) and q(x) are certain polynomials with integral coefficients 
(each with leading coefficient 1). In this event, either p(x) = 1 and 
q(x) = 1, or else p(x) — — 1 and q(x) = — 1, for each of the values 
x — a lf x = a 2 , x = a 3f x = a n . We shall show that the poly¬ 
nomial p(x) [and, of course, £(*)]-will be, for all values x = a ly x = a 2t 
■'*, x = a n , either equal to 1, or for all these values of x equal to 
- 1 . 

In fact, if (for example) the polynomial p(x) takes on the value 1 
for x = ai but assumes the value —1 for x = aj (i i= j) f then for some 
intermediate value of x between a, and aj it must become zero [the 
polynomial p(x) is continuous; its graph will go from the —1 value 
for x = ai to the value +1 for x = aj> thus crossing the x-axis for 
some x such that ai < x < aj]. However, this is impossible, since 
the left side of equation (i) is always greater than 1 and therefore 
cannot become zero. 

Let us assume that p(x) and q(x) both take on the value 1 for 
x = a x x = a 2 , • ■ *, x = a n . In this case, both p(x) — 1, and q(x) — 1 
become zero for x = a Uj x = a 2 , • * •, x = a n , and, consequently, p(x) — 1 
and q(x) — 1 are divisible by the product ( x — a x ) * (x — a 2 ) • * • (x — a n ). 
Since the sum of the degrees of the polynomials p(x) and q(x) must 
be equal to the degree of (x — a x ) z (x — a 2 ) 1 • • * (x — a n ) 2 + 1, that is, 
2«, it follows that p(x) — 1 = (x — a x ) • • ■ (x — a n ) and q(x) — 1 = 
(x — a L ) ■ * • (x — a n ) (compare with the solution of the preceding prob¬ 
lem). We also have the identity 

(x - a x y(x - a 2 y ■■•(* — a n y + 1 = p(x)q(x) 

= [(* - a x ) • * * (x - a n ) + 1] [(x - a x ) • * ■ (x - a n ) + 1] 

= (x — a x y(x — a 2 y ■••(* — a n y 

+ 2(x - a x )(x - a 2 ) ■ * • (x - a n ) + 1 , 

from which we must conclude that 

(x — a x )(x - a 2 ) ■ * • (x - a n ) = 0 . 

This is impossible; hence we must conclude that neither p(x) nor 
q(x) can take on the value 1 for all the x — a ir It can be shown in 
exactly the same way that neither p(x) nor q(x) can assume the value 
— 1 at the points x = a u x = a 2 , • * *, x = a n (if they could, we would 
obtain p(x) = q(x) = (x — a x )(x — a 2 ) * * • (x — a n ) —1).

as the product of two polynomials with integral coefficients is im¬ 
possible. 

212. Let the polynomial P(x) be equal to 7 for j x — a y x = b, x = c, 
and x = d, where a y b t c t and d are integers. Then the equation 
P(x) — 7 has four integral roots a, b t c t and d. This means that the 
polynomial P(x) — 7 is divisible by x — a f x — b t x — c t and x — d, r 
that is, 

P(x) - 7 = (x - a)(x - b)(x - c)(x - d)p(x) , 

where p(x) is the remaining factor (it may be constant). 

Now let us suppose that the polynomial P( x) takes the value 14 
for the integral value x — A. Upon substituting x — A into the 
preceding identity, we obtain, since P(A) = 14, 

7 = (A- a)(A - b)(A - c)(A - d)p(A) , 

which is impossible, since the integers A — a t A — b t A — c y and 
A — d are all distinct, and 7 cannot be expressed as a product of 
five factors of which at least four are distinct. 

213. If a polynomial of seventh degree is factorable as the product 
of two polynomials p(x) and q(x) with integral coefficients, then the 
degree of one of these factors does not exceed 3. Let us assume 
that p(x) is such a factor. If P(x) has the value +1 or else —1 for 
seven integral values of x t then p(x) has the value +1 or —1, for 
those same values of x [since all coefficients are assumed to be 
integers, and since p(x)q(x) = P(*)]. Among the seven integral values 
of x for which p(x) has the value +1 or —1, there must be at least 
four for which p(x) will have the value 1 or else four for which p(x) 
will have the value —1. In the first instance the third-degree equa¬ 
tion p(x) — 1 = 0 has four roots, and in the second instance the 
equation p(x) + 1=0 has four roots. No such polynomial p(x) of 
third degree can exist, since neither p(x) — 1=0 nor p(x) +1=0 
can have four roots [They would have to be divisible by a polynomial 
of fourth degree. Compare with the solution of problem 210 (a).] 

214. Let p and q be two integers which are either both even or 
both odd. Then the difference P(p) — P(q) is even, since the value 

f Assume that P(x) — 7 has a remainder r when divided by x — a. Then 

P(x) — 7 = (x - a)Q(x) + r . 

If we set x = a in this equality, we obtain 7 — 7 = 0 + r (that is, r = 0), and 
this means that P(x) — 7 = (x — a)Q(x) is divisible by x — a.

P(P) - P(q) = (/>* - <?") + _

In particular, for even p the difference P(p) - P( 0) is even. But 
by hypothesis P(0) is odd; consequently, P(P) must also be odd, 
and therefore P(p) * 0. Analogously, for odd P the difference 
P( P ) — P(l) is even. Since by hypothesis P(l) is odd, it must follow, 
by the same reasoning used above, that P(p) & 0. 

Consequently, P(x) cannot become zero for any integral value ot 
x (either even or odd); that is, the polynomial P(x) does not have 
integral roots. 

215. Let us assume that the equation P(x) = 0 has the rational 
root x =j, that is, p(j) = 0. Let us write the polynomial P(x)

prime to l (we assume, of course, that the fraction — is in lowest

is also relatively prime to /\ It follows that --- can be an 

r — pi 

integer only if k — pi — ±1. We may show, in exactly the same 
manner, that k — ql = dtl. 

Subtracting the equality k — pi = ±1 from the equality k — ql = 
±1, we obtain (p — q)l = 0 or {p — q)l = ±2. But (p — q)l > 0, since 
p > q and l > 0, and, consequently, (p — q)l = 2, k — pi ~ — 1, and 
£ — <?/= 1. 

Hence, if p — q > 2, then the equation P(*) = 0 cannot have any 
rational root. If, however, p — q = 2 or p — q = \, then a rational

that all the coefficients of the polynomial a n x n + + ■ • ■ + <z 0

(for k > m, this sum ends with the term a k - m b m ). This coefficient 
is equal to the corresponding coefficient of x k in the initial poly¬ 
nomial. That is, it is equal to zero if k is odd, and even if k is 
even (since all the coefficients of the polynomial, except the first, 
by hypothesis, are even, and k ^ n < 2222). But since, by assumption, 
all the numbers a k -u Gk-z, «*- 3 , are even, then in sum (1) a 

the terms other than the first must be even, and, therefore, the 
product a k bo must also be even, which cannot be since a* and bo are 
both odd. 

Therefore, all the coefficients of the polynomial 
a n x n + a n -iX n ~ l + ••• + a 0 

must be even, which contradicts the fact that a n b n must be equal 
to 1. Our assumption that it is possible to write the given poly¬

therefore untenable.

Further, since all the coefficients of the last-written polynomial, 
except the first, are divisible by the prime number 251 [^inasmuch as

the polynomial is 251, which is not divisible by 251*. we can, by 

using reasoning almost identical to that used in problem (a) and 

merely replacing eveness and oddness of coefficients with divisibility 
by 251, conclude that a necessary condition for the given polyomial 
to be expressed as the product of two factors is that all the coef¬ 
ficients of one of the factors be divisible by 251. However, this is 
impossible, since the first coefficient of the given polynomial is 1. 


217. Let us write the polynomials in the forms 
A = a 0 + cl\X + a 2 x 2 + * • • + a n x n , 

B = bo + hx + b 2 x 2 + * * ■ + b m x m . 

Since by hypothesis not all the coefficients in the product are divisi- 


324 


The Algebra of Polynomials 


ble by 4, not all the coefficients in both polynomials can be even. 
Consequently, in one of them (say, polynomial B) not all the coef¬ 
ficients will be even. Now assume that polynomial A also contains 
some odd coefficient. Let us examine the first of these to appear 
(that with the smallest subscript), and let us assume that this is the 
coefficient a s . Further, let the first odd coefficient of polynomial B 
be b k} and consider the coefficient of x k +* in the product of the poly¬ 
nomials A and B. The term x k +* in this product can be obtained 
only from those powers of x the sum of whose exponents is equal 
to k + s; consequently, this coefficient is equal to 

aobk+8 aibk+s-i a s -ib k +i + a s b k + a 8 +ib k ~i + • ■ * ~\~a a+k bo . 

In this sum all the products appearing before a a b k are even, since 
all the numbers are even. All the products appearing 

after a s b k are also even, since all the numbers b k -u b k ~ 2 , are 

even. But the product aJb k is odd, since both a a and b k are odd 
numbers. Consequently, the sum is also odd, and this contradicts 
the requirement that all the product coefficients be even. Therefore, 
the assumption that polynomial A has odd coefficients is untenable. 
Therefore, all the coefficients of A must be even, as was to be proved. 


218. We shall prove that for an arbitrary rational, but not inte¬ 
gral, value of x , the polynomial P(x) cannot be an integer, (nor zero, 
which we consider an integer). 

Let x = where p and q are relatively prime (that is, this frac¬ 
tion is in lowest terms). Then 

P{x) = x n + a x x n ~ l + a 2 x n ~ z + ■ ■ ■ + a n -ix + a n

The number p n > as well as />, is relatively prime to q\ consequently, 
P n + <7(fli/> w_l + • * • + a n q n ~ l ) is also relatively prime to q y hence also 
to q n . Therefore P{x) becomes an irreducible fraction which cannot 
be an integer.* 


f It is as easy to prove the more general theorem that if — (in lowest terms) 

q 

is a zero of P(x), then p divides a n and q divides the leading coefficient [Editor (.

219. Let N be a certain integer and let P(N) = M. For any inte¬

is divisible by kM— since (N + kM) 1 — N l is divisible by [(N + kM) — 
N — kM]— and hence also by M. Therefore, for any integer k , 
P(N + kM) is divisible by M. 

Thus, if we prove that among the values P(N + kM) (k = 0,1, 2,* ■ •) 
there are integers distinct from ±M, then this will prove that not 
all of them can be prime. But the polynomial P(x) of nth degree 
assumes a given value A for at most n distinct values of x (since 
otherwise the wth degree equation P(x) — A = 0 would have more 
than n roots). Hence, among the first 2n + 1 values of P(N + kM) 
(k = 0,1, 2, * • 2 n) there must be at least one which is distinct from 

M or —M. 

220. First we show that every polynomial P(x) of degree n can 
be expressed in terms of (as “a linear combination” of) polynomials 
of the form

P(X) = b n Pn(x) + bn-lPn-M + * * * + b.Pfx) + hP^X) . 

To prove this, we note that if b n is chosen such that the number

P(x) and b n Pn(x) + b n -\P n -\(x) + • ■ ■ + b 0 Po(x) have identical coefficients 

for x n . If b n - 1 is chosen such that - is equal to the leading

Express the given polynomial P(x) of degree n y which has the 
property that P(0), P(l), are integers, in the form (as out¬ 

lined above) 

P(x) = b 0 Po(x) + biPfx) + biP 2 (x) + • • ■ + b n Pn{x) . 

We see that 

Pi(0) = P 2 ( 0) = - - ■ = P„(0)

Therefore, 

P(0) = boPo(0) , 

whence b 0 = P(0); 

P(l) = 6oPo(l) + 6 iPi(1) , 
whence b { — P( 1) — fc 0 Po(l); 

P(2) = 6 0 Po(2) + b,P,(2) + b 2 P 2 ( 2) , 
from which it follows that 

h = P(2) - b 0 Po(2) - 6^(2) , 


P(») = b 0 Po(n) + 6iPi(«) + ■ ■ ■ + bn-vP n -i(n) + b n P n (n) ,

Thus, all the coefficients b Qy b ly b 2y are integers. 

221. (a) It was shown in the solution of problem 220 that a 
polynomial of degree n can be expressed as a linear combination 
of polynomials of form P 0 (jc), Pfx) y * ■ - , P*(jc) (see problem 220), where 
the coefficients of P* in the linear combination (series) are integers, 
and provided that P(k) is an integer for all integers k. The proof 
needed only the fact that P(x) had integral values for k — 0,1,2, • • *, n. 
Hence the polynomial of the present problem can, under the given 


Solutions (221-222)

conditions, be so represented. It is clear that the linear combination 
bnP n (x) + ■ • ■ b Q Po(x) must have integral value for all integers, hence, 
so must P(x). 

(b) If the polynomial P(x) = a n x n + a n -iX n ~ l + a n -iX n ~ 2 + ■ * * 
+ UiX + a Q has integral values for x = k, & + 1 , & + 2, ■ ■ ■ , k + n y 
then the polynomial

has integral values for * = 0,1,2, 3, ■ • -, n. It follows from problem 
(a) that Q(x) has integral values for every integer Therefore we 
must conclude that the polynomial P(x) = Q(* — k) also has integral 
values for every integer x. 

(c) Let the polynomial P(x) = a n x n + a n -iX n ~ l + ■ • ■ + a { x + a Q 

have integral values for jc = 0,1,4, 9, Then the polynomial 

Q(x) = P(x z ) = a n (x 2 ) n + a n+l (x 2 ) n - 1 + - * * + a,x 2 + a 0 of degree 2 n has 
integral values for 2n + 1 consecutive values of x y that is, for 
* = -( W - 1), -(«-2), -1,0,1, « — 1, «- In fact, it 

is obvious that 

Q(0) = P( 0) , Q(3) = <?(—3) = P(9), 

Q(1) = Q(-1) = P(1), .. 

0(2) = 0(-2) = P(4) , 0(») = ©(-») = ^(« 2 ) . 

and all these numbers, by hypothesis, are integers. Consequently, 
basing our reasoning on problem (b), we may say that the poly¬ 
nomial Q(x) has integral values for every integral value of x. This 
also means that P(k 2 ) = Q(k) is, for any integer k y an integer.

cos 60 cos 6 0 — 15 cos 4 0 sin 2 0 + 15 cos 2 0 sin 4 0 — sin 6 0 


Dividing the numerator and denominator of the last fraction by 
cos 6 a y we obtain the desired formula: 


tan 60 = 


6 tan 0 — 20 tan 3 0 + 6 tan 5 0

224 . We may rewrite the equation x + — = 2 cos a: in the form 
x 2 + 1 = 2 x cos 0 


Thus, 


x z — 2 x cos 0 + 1=0. 


x = cos 0 ± t/cos 2 0 — 1 = cos 0 ± i sin 0 .

(b) Let AiB lf A 2 B 2 , •• ■, AnBn be perpendiculars drawn from

theorem of problem 234 (a), if we take into account that for an even n,

236. In problem 234 (a) we found that the sum of the squares of 
the distances from a point on a circle circumscribed about a regular 
«-sided polygon to all of its vertices is equal to 2nR 2 . If we assume 
that M coincides with A u then the sum of all sides and diagonals 
of the n-g on emanating from one vertex is equal to 2nR 2 . If we 
multiply this sum by n (the number of vertices of the «-gon) then 
we obtain double the sum of all the sides and diagonals of the n-gon 
(since every side or diagonal has two ends, it counts twice in the 

n 

sum). The sum we seek is therefore equal to — *2 nR z = n 2 R 2 .

From this we immediately obtain the result that the sum of the 
50th powers of all the sides and diagonals of a 100-sided polygon is 
equal to

238. We make use of the fact that in a triangle with integral 


sides a, b , and c the number 2 cos A = 


b 2 + c 2 


(law of cosines, 


where A is the angle between b and c) is rational. Further, if A = 
m 

—180°, where m and n are integers, then cosnA = cos (w*180°) = 
n 

(-l) m . 

We shall now show that 2cosw/l for an arbitrary integer n can 
be expressed as a polynomial of degree n in terms of 2 cos A with 
integral coefficients and having leading coefficient 1; that is, that 

2 cos nA = (2 cos A) n + a^(2 cos ^4)* -2 + a z (2 cos A) n ~* + * • - , 

where a ly a z , are integers. This assertion may by deduced from 

the first formula of problem 222 (a), or else proven by mathematical 
induction. Indeed, it is true for n = 1 and n — 2, since 

2 cos A — 2 cos A , 

2 cos 2A = (2 cos A) 2 — 2. 

But from the known product-to-sum identity we have 


cos (n + 2)A + cos nA = 2 cos A cos (n + l)A 















348 


Complex Numbers 


and so 

cos (n + 2) A = 2 cos A cos (n + \)A — cos nA , 

from which it immediately follows that if the assertion is true for 
the values n and n + 1, then it is also true for n + 2. Since the 
assertion is valid for n = 1 and n = 2, it follows that it is true for 
all values of n . 

By setting 2 cos A — x and cos mA = ( — l) m in the resulting formula 
we obtain the following equation with respect to the unknown x: 

x 71 + a y x n <l + a 2 x n ~ A + ■ • ■ — 2( — l) n = 0 . 


Thus x is a rational root (since, here, x — 2 cos A is rational) of 
an equation with integral coefficients whose highest-degree term has 
coefficient unity. But all the rational roots of such an equation must 
be integers (see problem 218); therefore, x — 2 cos A must be an inte¬ 
ger. Since 0 ^ cos A £ 1, the only possibilities are cos A = 0 or else 

cos A — that is, A may be 60°, 90°, or 120° (these are the only 

angles greater than zero but less than n = 180° for which 2 cos A is 
an integer). 

The existence of 60°, 90°, and 120° angles in triangles with integral 
sides may be shown by simple examples. A triangle with sides 
(3, 4, 5) is a right triangle—it has a 90° angle. In a triangle with 
sides (1,1, 1) all the angles are 60°. Finally, we cen verify (by the 
law of cosines, for example) that a triangle with sides (3,8,7) will 
have a 60° angle (between side 3 and side 8) and a (3, 5, 7) triangle 
will have a 120° angle (see also problem 128).

n 


integers (which will be considered relatively prime). From the second 


formula of problem 222 (b) we have 


sin nb = Cl cos ” -l b sin 0 — Cl cos' 1-3 6 sin 3 6 + Cn cos”' 5 0 sin 5 d — ■■■ .

cos 6 = — ,

sin 0 = i/T — cos 2 0 — ~ 1

and sin mb — sin 180°w = 0. Substituting these values into the last

except the first, are even integers (p 2 - 1 is even, since p is odd), 
the first term must also be even. Hence n is even, n = 2k, and there- 
fore m is odd. 

Since m is odd, it follows that 

COS kb = COS — = COS y 7T = 0 . 

From the first formula of problem 222 (b) we have 

cos kd = cos* e - cl cos* -2 e sin 2 d + Ct cos* -4 6 sin 4 d -. 

By setting cos 0 = sin 0 = ^ P p ~ > an( ^ cos = ® we 0 ^*- a * n 

0 = i-[i - Clip 2 -1) + clip 2 -1) 2 -]. 

p 

Here all the summands in the brackets, except the first, are even 
integers, and the first is equal to unity, that is, is odd. Therefore, 
the resulting equality is impossible. This contradiction proves that 
the ratio of 0 = arc cos — to 180° cannot be a rational number. 

(b) Let us assume that d = arc tan — contains a rational 

' Q yyj 

number of degrees, that is, that b can be expressed as b = — 180°, 

where m and n are integers. We shall consider p and q relatively 
prime, which is permissible, since we are interested only in the 

ratio We shall use the DeMoivre formulas 
Q 

(cos b + i sin b) n = cos nb + i sin nb 

and 

(cos b - i sin b) n = cos nb - i sin nb . 

Since b — —180°, we have sin nb = sin 180 °m = 0, and, consequently, 
n 


(cos b + i sin b) n = (cos b - i sin b) n .

Dividing both sides of this equality by cos 71 0 (cos d =£ 0 , since tan 0 = 

sin 0 p , . \ 

-— =3 where q =£ 0 ), we obtain 

cos 0 q 


that is, 


(1 + i tan 0) n = (1 — i tan 6) n , 




or, after multiplying by q n , 


(q + ip)» = (q - ip) n . 


We shall now show that this equality is impossible when p and q 
are integers, relatively prime, p *= 0, q * 0, and p and q are not 
simultaneously equal to ztl. To this end we express the equality as 

(q - ipy = [(q - ip) + 2 ipy 

= (Q - ip) n + C l n (q - ipy~ l 2ip + Cl(q - ipy~ 2 (2ip) 2 + • • • 

+ Cl~\q - ip)(2ipy - 1 + ( 2 ipy . 

Eliminating the term (q - ipy from the left and the right sides, 
dividing by 2 ip, and transposing (2 ip) n ~ l to the left side, we obtain 

-(2 ipy~ l = (q - ip)[Cn(q - ipy~ z + 

cl(q - ipy-* 2 ip + ■ ■ • + CT\ 2 ipy~ 2 ] . 

Each side of this equality is a complex number; by equating the 
moduli of these complex numbers and taking into account the fact 
that the modulus of the product equals the product of the moduli of 
the factors, we find 


(2 py*~ z = (, q 2 + p 2 )B , 

where B is the modulus of the expression within the brackets on the 
right side of the preceding equality. Thus B is equal to the sum of 
the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the number, 

C l n(q - ipy~ 2 + Cl(q - ip)*-*2ip + • • ■ + CT\2ipy~ 2 , 

and is therefore an integer. Thus ( 2 p) 2n ~ 2 is divisible by p 2 + q 2 . 
But since p and q are relatively prime, p 2 + q 2 does not have common 
factors with p and q\ that is, 2 2n ~ 2 must be divisible by p 2 + q 2 . The 
numbers p and q are either both odd, or one is even and the other 
odd. If one is even and the other odd, then p 2 + q 2 will be odd, but 
if p = 2r + 1 and q = 2 s + 1 (both odd), then 


Solutions (240) 


351 


p 2 + q 2 = 2 (2r 2 + 2r + 2s 2 + 2s + 1) 

will be even, but it will contain the odd factor 2 (r 2 + r + s 2 + s) + 1. 
This odd factor becomes unity only for p = ±1, q = dtl. Therefore 
for all remaining cases 2 2n_2 cannot be divisible by p 2 + q 2 . That is, 

6 = arc tan — cannot contain a rational number of degrees. 

Q 

240. First Solution . Assume that a is not divisible by p. Then 
the integers a y 2a y 3 a } ••*,(/> — 1 )a will also fail to be divisible by />, 
and they will yield different remainders when divided by p [if ka 
and la (p — 1 ^ k > l) produced identical remainders when divided 
by />, then the difference ka — la — (k — l)a would be divisible by />, 
which is impossible, since p is prime, a is not divisible by p , and 
k — l is less than p.] But since, upon division by />, all possible 
remainders are exhausted by the p — 1 numbers 1, 2, 3, ■•*,/> — 1, it 
necessarily follows that 

a = q^p + a { , 

2a = q 2 p + a 2 , 

3a = q*p + a 3 , 


(p - 1 )a = q p— i p + a P -, , 

where a ly a 2 , *■*,£?-1 are the positive integers 1,2, --- y p — l y taken 
in some order. Multiplying together all these equalities, we obtain 

[1 *2* •*(/> — 1 )]a p ~ l = Np + <Zi<z 2 * * -tfp-i , 

[1-2- "(p - l)](a p ~ l -l) = Np. 

Therefore it follows that a p ~ l — 1 is divisible by />, and a p — a is 
also divisible by p. (If a is initially divisible by p y then the asser¬ 
tion of Fermat's theorem is obvious.) 

Second Solution. The theorem is obvious for a = 1, since in that 
case a p — a — \ — 1 = 0, We shall now apply mathematical induction 
to the positive integer a y and show that if a p — a is divisible by p y 
then it will follow that (a + l) p — (a + 1) is divisible by p. 

By use of the binomial theorem we find that 

(a + 1 ) p ~(a + l) = a p + pa p ~ l + Cla p ~ 2 + C\a p ~ 3 +•••+pa + l-a-l

Some Problems in Number Theory 


are divisible by the prime number />, since C P is an integer and since 
the numerator of the above expression for C P contains the factor p 
whereas the denominator does not contain this factor. But since, by 
the induction hypothesis, a p — a is also divisible by />, it follows that 
(a + l) p — {a + 1) is divisible by p. 

We shall detail a more elegant variation of the same proof. Be¬ 
cause all the binomial coefficients C P are divisible by />, the difference 

(A + B) p — A p — B p 

= pA p ~'B + C 2 P A p -*B 2 + ■ • • + C P ~ 2 A 2 B p ~ z + pAB p ~ 2 

where A and B are any integers, is always divisible by p. If we 
apply this result, we find that 

(A + B + C) p - A p - B p - C p 

= {[(A + B) + C\ p - (A + By - C p } + (A + By - A p -B p 

is always divisible by p\ that 

(A + B + C + D) p - A p - B p - C p - D p 

= {[(A + B + C) + D] p -(A + B + C) p ~ D p } 
+ (A + B + C) p - A p - B p - C p 

is always divisible by p\ and that, in general, 

(A + £ + C + • ■ * + K) p - A p - B p - C p - ■ ■ ■ - K p 

is always divisible by p. 

If in the last expression we now set A = B — C = — K — 1, 

and if we let the number of these terms be equal to a> we arrive at 
Fermat's theorem: a p — a is divisible by p. 

241. The proof of Euler's theorem is completely analogous to the 
first proof of Fermat's theorem. Let k lt k 2 , ■ • •, k T be the set of natural 
numbers which are less than, and relatively prime to, the integer N. 
We consider the r numbers k { a>k 2 a, ■■■, kra . All of these are rela¬ 
tively prime to N (since a is by hypothesis also relatively prime to 
N), and all of them, when divided by N , will yield different re¬ 
mainders (this is proven exactly as in problem 240). We may write 

kia = q^N + a v , 
k 2 a = q 2 N + a 2 , 


k T a = q r N + a T ,

where must be the same numbers as A„ h ■ • • - though 

in different order (since clearly the at are distinct, all less than N, 
and if a; were not relatively prime to N, then neither would be ki). 

If we multiply together all the equalities, we obtain 

fc.Av • ■k T a r = NM + aiflr • •«>-, 

Wi-'Wfl'- 1) = NM ’ 

whence it follows that the integer a T - 1 is divisible by N. 

242. We shall prove this by mathematical induction. First, it is 
evident that for m = 1 the proposition of the problem is correct: 

2‘ — 1 = 1 , 

2 2 - 1 = 3 , 

2 3 - 1 = 7 

are not divisible by 5. We shall show that the proposition holds also 
f or n _ 2 Let 2 k be the smallest power of the number 2 which wil 
produce a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 2 = 25. (That is k is 
least such that 2* - 1 is divisible by 25.) Now, assume that k < 

5 2 — 5 = 25 — 5 = 20. If 20 is not divisible by k (that is, 20 - qk + r, 
where 0 < r < 6), then we obtain 

2 20 — i — 2 qk vr — 1 = 2 r (2 fl<c — 1) + (2 r ~~ 1) ■ 

But 2 20 — 1 is divisible by 25 (by Euler's theorem), and 2 q — 1 - 
(2 k Y - 1* is divisible by 2 fc - 1, which, by assumption, is also divisible 
by 25; therefore 2 r - 1 must be divisible by 25, which is a contra¬ 
diction of the assumption that k is the smallest number for which 
2 fe — 1 is divisible by 25. Therefore, k must be a divisor ofj:he 
number 20; that is, k can be equal to only 2,4,5, or 10. But 2 
2’-1=31 and 2” - 1 = 1023 are not divisible by 5, whereas 
2 4 _ i = 15 ’ is divisible by 5, but is not divisible by 25. Thus, the 

proposition of the problem holds also for n = 2. 

Let us now assume that the proposition of the problem h °lds for 
some m, but is invalid for n + 1 , that is, that the least * such that 
2 * - 1 is divisible by 5" +1 is less than 5 ” +1 - 5” - 4-5*. We can s ow, 
exactly as above (for n = 2 ), that k must be a divisor of the number 
4-5*. But, moreover, we can show analogously that the number 
5 * _ 5 »-i = 4 . 5*- 1 must be the divisor of the number k. If it wer 
true that k = ?-4-5- + r. where 0 < r < 4-5-', then 5' - 1 would 
be divisible by 5 », which contradicts the hypothesis that the propo- 





354 Some Problems in Number Theory 

sition of the problem is valid for the number n. Thus k has only 
one possible value: & = 4-5* _1 . 

Since the number 

25 n-I -5*~ 2 _ j __ 2 **s*-2 _ i 

is divisible by 5* 1 (from Euler’s theorem) and is not divisible by 5* 
(otherwise the hypothesis would not be true for n), then 

2 1 ' 5 ’- 2 = q- 5 -‘ + 1 , 

where q is not divisible by 5. From the expansion 

(a + b) s = a 5 + 5 a*b + 10a 2 b 2 + 10 a*b 3 + 5 ab* + b s 

we obtain 

2 ^"-‘ - 1 = (2 ‘->"- 2 )s - 1 = (q . 5 -. + l)» - l 

= 5 n+l (q i -5 ln ~ i + q*- 5 3 "- 5 + 2q 3 -5 in -* + 2q 1 -5 n ~ 3 ) + q-5 " , 

whence it is clear that 2*' 5 " -1 — 1 is not divisible by 5* +l . Hence, 
the truth of the proposition for n implies that it is also true for 
« + 1, whence the statement holds for all integers. 

243. According to Euler’s theorem (see problem 241), the number 

2 510 - 59 — \ — 2 4 ’5 9 _ \ = 2^'812,500 _ J 

is divisible by 5 10 ; therefore, for n ^ 10 the difference 

2?. 812,500 + n 2 n = 2 n (2 7,812 ' 500 1) 

is divisible by 10“ That is, the last ten digits of the number 
27,ai2, 500 +n coincide with 2™. This means that the last ten digits of 
the numbers of the sequence 2\ 2 2 , 2 3 , * ■ ■, 2™, • ■ ■ will repeat after 
every 7,812,500 numbers. Moreover, this periodicity begins with the 
tenth number of this sequence, that is, with 2 10 . 

It follows from the result of problem 242 that the period is, actual¬ 
ly not less than 7,812,500. 

Remark : It can be proven analogously that the last n digits of the numbers 
in the sequence under consideration will repeat every 4-5 n ~i numbers, begin* 
ning with the nth number of this sequence (for example, the last two digits 
would repeat, beginning with the second number, every 20 numbers). 

244. We shall prove an even more general theorem, namely, that 
for any integer N there is always a power of 2 whose last N digits 
will always be ones and twos. Since 2 5 = 32 and 2 9 = 512, the propo¬ 
sition is valid for N= 1 and N = 2. We shall carry out the proof 
by mathematical induction. 


Solutions ( 243-245) 


355 


Assume that for some natural number N the final N digits of the 
number 2 n are ones and twos. We are to show that there is a power 
of 2 whose last N + 1 digits will be ones and twos. 

According to the induction hypothesis, 2 n = a-10 /V + b, where b is 
an W-digit integer whose digits are all ones or twos. Let us designate 
the number 5 A — 5 A_1 = 4*5 JV ~ 1 by the letter r\ then by Euler's theo¬ 
rem (problem 241), the difference 2 r — 1 will be divisible by 5 A . It 
follows that if the integer k is divisible by 2 A+1 , then the difference 
2 T k — k = k{2 T — 1) will be divisible by 2-10 A . That is, the final N 
digits of 2 T k and k will coincide, and the (N + l)st digit from the 
end of each will be both odd or both even. 

Let us now consider the following five powers of 2: 

2™, 

2*+t _ 2 r -2 n , 

2 n+Zr = 2 r -2 n+r , 

2«+3r — 2 r *2 n+2r 
2»+4r — 2 r .2 n+3r 

From what we have shown, the final N digits of all of these numbers 
will coincide (each of the numbers, as well as 2", will terminate in 
the same number, b , which consists entirely of one and twos), but 
the digits in the (N + l)st place from the end of all of them will be 
simultaneously even or odd. We shall now prove that the digits in 
the (N + l)st place from the end cannot be identical for any two of the 
five numbers. In fact, the difference of any two of the numbers 
can be expressed as 2 n+7n i r (2 m ^ r — 1), where m x =0,1,2, or 3, but 
w 2 = l,2,3, or 4. If this difference is divisible by 10 AM1 , then 
2 m z r — 1 must be divisible by 5 A+1 ; but since 

m 2 r = m 2 -( 5 A - 5 A ~ l ) < 5*(5 A - 5 A ^) = 5 A+1 - 5 A , 

this contradicts the result of problem 242. 

Therefore, the digits standing in the (N + l)st place from the end 
of the above five integers must be either 1,3, 5, 7, and 9 (all ap¬ 
pearing) or else 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (in what order, we do not know). In 
either event, in one of these integers the (N + l)st digit from the 
end must be 1 or else 2. This means that, in any event, there exists 
a power of 2 whose final N + 1 digits can comprise only the digits 
1 and 2. This induction proves the proposition of the problem. 

245. Let a be one of the numbers of the x sequence 2, 3, — 2. 

Consider the integers

Some Problems in Number Theory 


a, 2a, •■•,(/> — 1 )a . 

Clearly, no two of these integers can yield the same remainder 
upon division by p\ therefore those remainders will be the positive 
integers 1, 2, 3, ■■*,/>- 1 (all appearing, but in what order is unknown 
and not important). (Compare with the solution of problem 240.) In 
particular, there will be an integer b in the sequence 1,2, • — 1 

such that ba , when divided by p , will have a remainder of 1 . Now, 
^ ^ 1 an d b q= p — 1, since 2 S a ^ p — 2, and were b = 1 then the 
number ba — a when divided by p would yield remainder a =£ 1; and 
were b = p - 1 the number ba = (p - 1 )a = pa - a when divided by 
p would yield the remainder p - a *= 1. Moreover, b * a, since if a 2 
yielded a remainder of 1 when divided by p , then a 2 - 1 = (a + 1 )(a - 1) 
would be divisible by p } which is possible only for a = 1 and a = 
P ~ 1* Therefore, 2 S b ^ p — 2, and b ^ a, which means that each 
of the numbers 2, 3, ’*•,/> — 2 can be paired with one other distinct 
integer of this set such that the product of this pair yields a remainder 
of 1 upon division by p. Accordingly, the product 2-3-4-**/>-2 it¬ 
self yields a remainder of 1 when divided by />. 

Now the number p — 1 may be thought of as yielding the remainder 
— 1 upon division by p. It follows that 

(p - 1)! - 1-2-3- • -(p - 2)(p - 1) - [2-3-. •(/> - 2)Hp - 1) 
has the remainder —1 when divided by p. That is, 

(P - 1)! = kp - 1 ; 

(p-l)\+l=kp, 

which says that (p - 1)! + 1 is divisible by p. 

If p is not prime, it must have a prime divisor q < p. Then 
(p- 1)! is divisible by q, since q is one of the factors in (p - 1)!. 
But then q cannot divide (p - 1)! + 1; hence neither can p . 

246. Let p = An + 1 be a prime number. By Wilson's theorem 
(problem 245), the number (/> - 1)! + 1 = (1-2-3-•-4;/) + 1 is divisible 
by p. Now in (4;z)! we shall replace each factor exceeding 2n by the 
identical number expressed in terms of p and n. For example, since 
P = 4n + 1, we may write 2n + 1 - p - 2n, 2n + 2 = p - (2n - 1), 
and so on, until, finally, 4n = p - 1. Then (p - 1)! = (Ayi)l = 1-2-3* 

• * *(2 n - 1)2 n(p - 2 n)[p - (2 n - 1)]- • ■(/> - 1). 

It is readily seen that if the right side is expanded, then every 
term will have p as a factor, except a final term which will be equal 
to [(2 n)\]\ Therefore, (p - 1)! + 1 = Ap + [(2 n)\] z + 1, where A repre¬ 


Solutions (246-247) 


357 


sents an expression unimportant to us. Since this number is divi¬ 
sible by p , and the term Ap is divisible by p , it follows that 


[(2;z)!] 2 + 1 is also divisible by p. Therefore, the number x = (2«)l = 



! satisfies the conditions of the problem. 


Remark : We note that if the integer x has the remainder xi when divided 
by p, then since 


x 2 + 1 = (kp + xi) 2 + 1 = (k 2 p 4- 2kxi)p + x\ + 1 , 
it follows that x\ + 1 is divisible by p. Therefore we might stipulate, as an 
additional condition of the problem, that x < p, since such an x — xi does exist. 


247. (a) The assertion of the problem follows immediately from 
the identity 

(a 2 + b 2 )(a\ + b\) = (aa, + bb,) 2 + (ab, - ba 0 2 . 


(b) First, it is easily shown that no number of the form 
An + 3 can be expressed as the sum of two squares. In fact, the 
square of every even number may be expressed as Ak , and the square 
of an odd number may be expressed as 4& + 1, since 


(2a + l) 2 = A(a 2 + a) + 1 . 


Accordingly, the sum of the squares of two even numbers may have 
the form 4n; the sum of the squares of two odd numbers may have 
the form An + 2; and finally, the sum of the squares of an even and 
an odd number may have the form An + 1. Thus, an integer which 
can be written as An + 3 cannot be the sum of two squares. 

It is a more involved matter to show that every prime number of 
the form An + 1 may be expressed as the sum of the squares of two 
integers. Let p be a prime of form An + 1. We know from problem 
246 that some multiple of p can be expressed as the sum of two 
squares; in fact, since there exists an integer x such that p divides 
x 1 + 1, there is an m such that 


mp — x z + 1 


(i) 


From the remark following problem 246 we may find x < p , whence 
x 1 + 1 < p 2 , and so in (1) we may assume that, because of the suitable 
choice of x, m < p. If m = 1, the proof is completed. Hence we 
shall assume that m =£ 1. 

Now, if yn is even, then x 2 + 1 is even, whence x must be odd. 
Then we can write 



358 


Some Problems in Number Theory 


That is, there exists an m' = ~ such that 

m'p = x\ + y \. 

If m' is again even, then either x : and ^ are both even, or else both 
are odd. In either event, we can easily determine (reasoning as 
above) that there exists an integer m ll (^= such that 

m ll p = x\ + y \. 

Now, if m is a power of 2, then the proof concludes in an obvious 
way. Hence we need consider only the case in which m is odd (to 
which the problem reduces if m fails to be a power of 2) and that 
we have 

mp = x 2 + y 2 

(whether y 2 = 1 or not is not important in the sequel). 

Let x, and y, be the least remainders in absolute value which can 
result when x and y, respectively, are divided by m: 


x = mr + , 

y = ms + y, 

(either of x t or y u or both, may be negative integers). Then \x t \ and 

ly*l are both less than Y (equality cannot hold, since m is odd), 
and we can write 

mp = x 2 + y 2 = (m 2 r 2 + 2mrx, + x\) + (m 2 s 2 + 2msy l + y J) . 

It is clear that xl + y? is divisible by m: 

x\ + y\ = mn 


(it is readily found that n = p ~ mr 2 - 2rx x - ms , - 2sy,). 

We note that n < f; indeed, since x, < f and y, < it follows 
that 2 2 


mn = x\ + yj < 





In addition, n 4= 0, since otherwise at and y would both be divisible 
by m and mp = x 2 + y 2 would be divisible by m 2 , which is impossible 
since p is prime and m is distinct from 1 and less than p. 

We shall now show that np may be expressed as the sum of the 
squares of two integers. From the identity in problem (a) we have 



Solutions (247)

mn mp — m 2 np = (x 2 + y 2 )(x? + y?) - (xx, + yy,) z + (xy t — yx i) 2 . 

But since x = mr + x t and y = ms + y lt the numbers

xyi — yx i = mry i + Xiy t — msx i — Xiy,. - m(ryi — sx 0 
are divisible by m. Thus we obtain 

n p = , 

which displays np as the sum of squares. 

If, now, n = 1, we are finished. If n =*= 1, we can, by using exactly 
the same method, decrease this number, that is, find an < n such 
that n x p can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. 
If «i fails to be 1, we can find an n 2 < n x such that n 2 p may be ex¬ 
pressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. Continuation of 
this process produces a strictly decreasing sequence of positive inte¬ 
gers for «i, which must terminate with 1. Therefore, the number 
1 *p can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers: 

p = X 2 + Y 2 , 

as was to be shown. 

(c) First, it follows almost immediately from the theorems 
in problems (a) and (b) that if a composite number N contains prime 
factors of the form 4 n + 3, but only even powers of them, then N 
can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. Indeed, 
in that case the number N can be expressed as a product P 2 Q , 
where all the prime factors of P are of form 4 n + 3, whereas all 
the odd prime factors of Q are of form in + 1. Since 2 = l 2 + l 2 , 
then, from the theorems of problem (b), all the prime factors of Q 
can be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. In that 
event, it follows from the theorem in problem (a) that even Q may 
be expressed as Q = x z + y 2 . But since this is so, 

N = p 2 >Q = (px) 2 + (Py) 2 

may also be expressed as the sum of the squares of two integers. 
This proves one part of problem (c). 

Let the composite number N, now, contain a prime factor p of the 
form in + 3 to an odd power: N = p 2k+l -m (where m is not now 
divisible by />)• We shall prove that N cannot be expressed as the 
sum of the squares of two integers. Indeed, assume that 


360 


Some Problems in Number Theory 


N= x 2 + y 2 , 

where x and y are integers. Then upon dividing x 2 } y 2 , and N by the 
square of the greatest common factor of x and y, we must arrive at 
the equality 

M = X? + Yi , 

where M is still divisible by p: M— Myp. By substituting for X Y 
and Yi their remainders x L and y L upon division by p , we obtain the 
equality mp = x\ + y\ t where m < p [compare with the remarks after 
problem (246)]. But here, as in solution (b), p can be written as 
the sum of the squares of two integers, which is impossible [see the 
beginning of the solution of part (b)]. This completes the proof. 


248. For p = 2 we have, trivially, 2 = l 2 + 0 2 + 1. For an odd 
prime p we shall give a constructive method for finding two numbers 
x and y, both less than which satisfy the condition of the prob¬ 
lem. 

Consider the ^ + * integers 0, 1, 2, ■■ ■, ^ The squares of 

^ La 

any two of these numbers, when divided by />, will yield different 
remainders. In fact, the equations 

x\ = kip + r , 
x\ = k 2 p + r 

would imply that 

x\ — x\ = (Xi — x 2 )(x l + x 2 ) = — k 2 )p . 


(*i - X 2 )(x v + x 2 ) 

would be divisible by p t which is impossible since x L < — and x z < 
and so 

Xy + x 2 < p , 


I *i - x 2 1 < p 


(remember that p is a prime number). Hence the numbers of the set 

0 2 , l 2 , 2 2 , *•*,(— -yield ^ * distinct (nonnegative) remainders 

when divided by />. This implies that the —-— (negative) numbers 
— 1, —l 2 — 1, — 2 2 — 1 , - - - , ~ ( ^ 2 * ~) ~ * when divided by p also 
yield ^ different (nonnegative) remainders (if — x\ — 1 and —x\ — 1 


Solutions ( 248-249) 


361 


y-ield identical remainders, then x\ and xl also yield identical re- 
rxiainders r ). But since there are only p distinct (nonnegative) re¬ 
mainders possible after division by p (namely, 0,1,2, •*■,/> —1), it 

is clear that of the p + 1 numbers 0 2 , l 2 , 2 2 , ■ • *, { ^2 ^ ) ’ — ^ 

— 2 2 — 1, ■ ■ ^ — 1 at least two of them must yield the same 

remainder when divided by p . From what has been shown above 
for pairs of this kind, one number must be of the form x 2 and the 
other of the form — y 2 — 1. But if 

x 2 = kp + r , 

— y 2 — 1 = lp + r , 

then 

x*+y* = (k-l)p-\ = mp-\\ 

that is, x 2 + y 2 + 1 = mp is divisible by p. 

Remark : The problem could have required that neither of the integers x or 
y is to exceed p/2, that is, that the sum x 2 + y 2 + 1 be less than p 2 and the 
quotient m resulting from the division of x 1 + y 2 + 1 by p be less than p. 

249. (a) The assertion of the problem follows from the following 

identity: 

(jc? + xl + + y\ + y\) 

= (xiyi + x 2 y 2 + x 3 y 3 + x A y A ) 2 + (x t y 2 — x 2 y L + x 3 y 4 — x 4 y 3 ) 2 
+ (xiy 3 — x 3 yi + x 4 y 2 — x 2 y 4 ) 2 + Ui y< — x A y 1 + x 2 y 3 — x 3 y 2 ) 2 , 
the validity of which can readily be verified. 

Remark : Since the identity just displayed is rather involved, let us note its 
relationship to the simpler identity in problem 247 (a). The identity in problem 
247 (a) may be generalized in the following manner: 

(aa f + bb')(aia[ + 616 ') = (aa[ + bb[)(aia' + bib') + (abi - bai)(a'b[ - b'a[) . 

If in the last identity we now set 

a — x 1 + ix% , ai = yi + iy2 , 

a' = x 1 — ix 2 , a[ = yi — iy 2 , 

b = x 3 + ix 4 , bi = 2/3 + iy\ , 

b f = xz - ix* , b[ = y 3 — iy 4 , 

where i = \ — 1, then we arrive at the identity of the present problem. 

t The quotient q and the (nonnegative) remainder r resulting upon the di¬ 
vision of a positive or a negative integer a by p are determined by the formula 
a = qp + 7 *, where 0 ^ r < p, and the quotient q is negative for negative a. 




362 


Some Problems in Number Theory 


(b) Since each integer may be expressed as a product of 
prime numbers, the result of problem (a) reduces this problem to 
showing that every prime number p may be expressed as the sum 
of the squares of four integers. 

The proof of this proposition is completely analogous to the solu¬ 
tion of problem 247 (b). We know, from the result of problem 248, 
that there exists a number m such that mp may be expressed as the 
sum of the squares of at most four integers: 

mp — x\ + x\ + x\ + xl 


(we can consider x 3 = 1 and x 4 = 0 , although we do not need that 
information). We can further consider m < p (see the remarks on 
the solution of problem 248). We shall show that if m > 1 , then m 
can be reduced; that is, we can always find some number n < m such 
that np can also be expressed as the sum of at most four squares. 

This proof is straightforward if m is even, since in that case 

mp = x\ + x\ + xt + xl 

is even, and either all Xk (& = 1, 2, 3, 4) are even, or two of them are 
odd and the other two even, or they are all odd. In every case the 
four numbers x L , x 2 , x 3 , and x 4 can be grouped into two pairs (say, 
x v ; x?. and x 3 , x 4 ), each pair consisting of two even or two odd num¬ 
bers. Then the numbers 



That is, the number — •/> can also be expressed as the sum of the 
squares of at most four integers. 

The case where m is odd is more involved. Let us substitute y k 
(& = 1,2, 3,4) for the remainder, smallest in absolute value, which 
can appear when x k is divided by m (if when x k is divided by m 

\ yyi 

there is a positive remainder greater than —, then we increase the 


Solutions (249) 


363 


quotient by 1 and show a negative remainder, whose magnitude is 
then <f): 

x k = mq k + }'k (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) , 

)72 ( 

where >•* is a positive or negative integer and \y t \ < — (none of the 

yyi _ \ ' 

integers y k can have magnitude —, since m is odd). 

We now have 

xl = m 2 ql + 2mq k y k + yl = rnQ k + yt (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) , 
where Q k = mql + 2q k y k is an integer. Therefore, 

mp = x\ + xt + x\ + x] = mq + y\ + yl + ^3 + yl 
(here q = Q v + Q 2 + Q* + ©0 an( ^ 

yl + yt + yl + y\ = n 

(here n — p — q). In this connection n < m, since 

rnn = yl + yl + + yl < 4^) = > 

moreover, n 4= 0, since otherwise all x k would be divisible by m and 
xl + xl + xt + xl = mp would necessarily be divisible by m 2 , which 
is impossible, since p is prime and m is different from 1 and less 
than p . 

We now show that the number np also can be expressed as the 
sum of not more than four squares. We shall see that each of the 
numbers mp and mn can be expressed as the sum of not more than 
four squares. From the identity proven in problem (a), it follows 
that the product 

mp-mn = mhip 

may also be expressed as the sum of the squares of four numbers: 
m z np = (x l y l + x 2 y 2 + x 3 y* + x 4 y 4 ) 2 

+ (^>'2 — x 2 y^ + x%y A — x 4 y 3 ) 2 
+ (xiyi — x 3 y l + x 2 y 4 - x 4 y 2 ) 2 
+ (*i y 4 — x 4 y\ + x 2 y* — y 2 ) 2 • 

We shall show that both sides of the last equality may be divided 
by m 2 . Let us substitute on the right side of the equality mq k + y k 
for all x k . We see that all the expressions in parentheses on the 




364 


Some Problems in Number Theory 


right side of the equality are divisible by m: the expression in the 
first set of parentheses is divisible by m, since y\ + y\ + y\ + y\ = mn 
is divisible by m y and the expressions in the remaining three sets 
of parentheses are divisible by m because after the substitution 
Xk = mq k + yk all the products of the form yiy z , and so on, cancel. 
Now if we divide the last equality by m 2 , we obtain 

np — z\ + zl + z\ + Z\ , 

as was to be shown. 

Thus, if the number m in the equation 

mp = X\ + x<i + x\ -}- xj 

is not equal to 1, it can always be decreased; that is, there will al¬ 
ways be a positive n < m for which a similar equality exists. If 
n -£ 1, we can still decrease the number n. In this way we obtain 
a strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers m > n > n v > 
until in at most a finite number of steps we obtain 

p = X? + Xi + Xl + X'? . 

250. Let us assume that 4"(8& — 1) = X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 , where X r Y, 
and Z are integers (one or even two of which may be zero). For 
n > 0, the numbers X , Y, and Z must all be even, for if precisely 
one is odd (and the other two even), then the sum X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 will 
be odd, and if two are odd (for example, X = 2k + 1 and Y = 21 + 1) 
and the other (for example, Z = 2m) is even, then the sum 

X 2 + Y 2 + Z 2 = (2k + l) 2 + (21 + l) 2 + (2m) 2 
= 4(£ 2 + k + l 2 + l + m 2 ) + 2 
is not divisible by 4. Now if we set 

Y ? 



we arrive at the equation 

4»- | (8ft - 1) - X? + Yi + Zi . 

If n > 1 (n — 1 > 0), it can be shown, exactly as before, that all three 
of the numbers X u Y v and Z v also must be even, from which we 
obtain the equation 

4*~ 2 (8k - 1 ) = Xi + Yi + zi , 


Solutions (250-251) 


365 


where X if Y 2t Z 2 are integers. Continuing to reason in exactly the 
same way, we are finally led to the conclusion that the number 
8k - 1 also must be expressible as the sum of three integers; 

8k — 1 = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 . (1) 

Either one, or else all three, of the numbers x,y, z must be odd; 
in any other case the sum x 2 + y 2 + z 2 would be even. But the square 
of an odd number 2 n + 1, 

(2 n + l) 2 = 4 n 2 + 4n + 1 = 4 n(n + 1) + 1 , 

always has a remainder of 1 when divided by 8 [since one of the 
consecutive numbers n and n + 1 must be even, which means that 
4 W ( W _j_ i) i s divisible by 8]. The square of an even number has a 
remainder of 0 when divided by 8 (if the number itself is divisible 
by 4) or else a remainder of 4 (if the number itself is not divisible 
by 4). This implies that if all the numbers x , y, z are odd, then the 
sum x 2 + y 2 + z 2 has a remainder of 3 when divided by 8, and if two 
of them are even, and one is odd, then when x 2 + y l + z 2 is divided 
by 8 there must be a remainder of 1 or 5. Thus, the sum of the 
squares of three integers can never yield a remainder of 7 when it 
is divided by 8. This contradiction of (1) proves the theorem. 

251. We employ the identity 

(a + by + (a - b) A = 2a* + 12 a 2 b 2 + 2ft 4 , 
which follows from the expansions 

( a + b)* = a 4 + 4 a z b + 6a 2 b 2 + 4 ab 2 + b 4 , 

(a — b) A — a K — 4a z b + 6fl 2 ft 2 — 4 ab z + b 4 . 

It follows from this identity that 

[(a + by + (a- by] + [(a + c) 4 + (fl - cy] 

+ [(a + dy + (a - dy\ + [(b + c)* + (b - c)<] 

+ [(b + dy + (b - dy] + [(c + dy + (c- dy] 

= 6a* + 6ft 4 + 6c 4 + 6</ 4 + 12 a 2 b 2 + 12a 2 c 2 + 12 a 2 d 2 
+ 12ft 2 c 2 + 12 b 2 d 2 + 12 c 2 d 2 = 6(a 2 + ft 2 + c 2 + d 2 ) 2 . 

Thus 

6(a 2 + b 1 + c 2 + d*Y 

= (a + by + (a - by + (a + c) 4 + (a - c) 4 + (a + d) 4 + (a - d) 4 

+ (b + c) 4 + (b- c) 4 + (b + d) 4 + (b- d) 4 + (c + d) 4 + (c - d) 4

Some Problems in Number Theory 


or, expressed in words: if a number can be expressed as the sum of 
four squares , then six times its square can be expressed as the sum of 
twelve integers , each raised to the fourth power. But, from the result 
of problem 250, each integer can be expressed as the sum of four 
squared integers (some of which may be zero); this implies that six 
times the square of each integer can be expressed as the sum of 
twelve integers, each raised to the fourth power (some of these may 
be zeros). 

An arbitrary integer N divided by 6 has a remainder of 0,1,2, 3, 
4, or 5; that is, 

N = 6n + r , 

where r = 0,1,2, 3, 4, or 5. Further, from the theorem of problem 
249 (b), the number n may be expressed as the sum of four squares 
of integers (some of which may be zeros): 

n = x 2 + y' 1 + z 2 + t 2 . 

By what has been shown above, each of the numbers 6x 2 f 6y 2 , 6z 2 , 
and 6/ 2 (which are expressed as six times the squares of integers) 
can be expressed as the sum of twelve integers each raised to the 
fourth power (some of which may be zeros). Thus the number 

6 n = 6x 2 + 6y 2 + 6z 2 +6/ 2 

can be expressed as the sum of 4*12 = 48 integers, each raised to 
the fourth power. But since r — 0,1,2, 3, 4, or 5, that is, 

Y = 0 4 + 0 4 + 0* + 0 4 + 0* , 

or r = T + 0 4 + 0 4 + 0 4 + 0 4 , 

or r = l 4 + T + 0 4 + 0 4 + 0 4 , 

or r = T + l 4 + l 4 + 0 4 + 0 4 , 

or r = l 4 + l 4 + T + l 4 + 0 4 , 

or r = l 4 + l 4 + l 4 + l 4 + l 4 , 

the integer N = 6n + r can be expressed in the form of the sum of 
48 + 5 = 53 fourth powers of integers (zeros allowed). 

252. Set 

a = x 3 + y 3 + z 3 . 

From the identity in the solution of problem 162 (b) we have 


Solutions (252)

(x + y + zf — a — (x + y + z) 3 — x 3 — y 3 — z %

or 

a = (x + y + z) 3 - 3(x + y)(x + z)(y + z) 

(see the hint for the present problem). This brings us to the new 
unknowns, x + y + z = Z t x + y = Y y and x. We have y — Y — x and 
z = Z— Y, and, therefore, 

a = (x + y + z) 3 — 3(x + y)(x + z)(y + z) 

= Z* -3Y(x+ Z- YXY-x+Z- Y) 

— Z z — 2Y(Z Y x — Y)(Z — x) 

= Z 3 - 3T(Z 2 - x z ) + 3 Y 2 (Z - x) . 

We can now simplify the equation considerably by supposing that 
the unknowns x t Y r Z are related by 

Z 3 = 3T(Z 2 - x 2 ) , 

or the equivalent 

z = 3i '[ i -(f)’] 

(see the hint for this problem). In this case our equation will take 
the form 

a = 3 Y\Z-x) = 3y 2 z(l - -|t) , 

or, since

Z= 3Y(1 - X 2 ) .

Finally, let us introduce, together with the unknown Y f a new 
unknown, Y — 3F(1 — X). Then the relation concerning the unknowns 
will take the form 

Z=Y(1 + X), 

and the equation will be in the form 

1 t7 3 1 + X 

a — — Y -

We are now at the end of the solution. Indeed, from the last 
equation X is expressed rationally in a (and F): 

x — 3 g ~~ z* 

3a + Y 3 * 

3 a — V 3 - 

Thus if X = ¥ -i- and Z = Y( 1 + X) y then 

3 a + Y 3 

a = x 3 + y 3 + z 3 , 

where x, y, and z are as in the following formulas: 


x = ZX, 
y — Y — x — 


z — Z — Y — Z 


3(1 - X) 

z - - - 

3(1 - X) 


From these formulas it follows, in particular, that x,y, and z are 
rational, if only the unknown F is rational. We may choose any 
desired F in the formulas. (This circumstance is analogous to that 
where we simplify the equation x 3 + y 3 + z 3 = a using the relation 
y = — z\ then the unknown z may be chosen arbitrarily. See the 
hints for this problem). 

We have thus found the solution to the equation 
x 3 + y 3 + z 3 = a 


in rational numbers (and even as many solutions as are desired which 
are related to the chosen distinct rational values of F). We have 
only to show that F may be so chosen that x, y, and z will be positive 
(here we may employ the positive number a , which we have not 
used as yet). Let us express Z = x + y -h z, Y = x + y, and Z — x = 
y + z in terms of X and F,

253. It follows from the result of problem 159 that there must be 
an infinite number of prime numbers. (That problem implies that 
prime numbers occur in the sequence of integers sufficiently “often”; 
for example, they occur “more often than” squares. See the remark 
to that problem). Also, from problem 65 we see that there must be 
an infinite number of prime numbers: if there existed only n prime 
numbers, then there would be no more than n number-pairs relatively 
prime to each other. 

A much simpler and more direct proof of the theorem of the in¬ 
finitude of prime numbers, ascribed to Euclid, is the following one. 

Let us suppose that in all there are n prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 
Let us form the number N — 2*3-5-7-11-••/>* + 1, The 
number N is greater than all the prime numbers 2,3,5, - - -, /> n and 
must therefore be composite. But since N— 1 is divisible by 2,3, 
5, 7, • • ■, p ny it follows that N is relatively prime to all prime numbers. 
This contradiction proves the theorem.

proof of the existence of an infinite number of primes. The integers

comprising the first sequence given in the problem are all those of 
form 4k — 1. Assume that only a finite number of primes appear in 
the sequence, that is, 3,7,11,19,23, Consider the number 

N = 4(3 • 7 • 11 • 19 • 23 ■ * • />*) — 1 . 

This integer exceeds every prime which appears in the given pro¬ 
gression, and so, being a number of form 4k — \ (hence belonging 
to the progression), it must be composite. Factor N into its prime 
factors, none of these factors can be of form 4& — 1, since N + 1 = 
4(3-7-11-15-19* - -/>^) is divisible by all primes of form 4& — 1, and, 
consequently, N is relatively prime to all these numbers. Since N 
is odd, it must then be representable as the product of primes of 
form 4& + 1. This is impossible, since the product of numbers of 
form 4& + 1 is again a number of this same form, 

(4k i + 1)(4& 2 + 1) — 16/?i&2 + 4k i + 4^2 + 1 

= 4(4k,k 2 + ki + k 2 ) + 1 = 4k, + 1 , 

and N is of form 4k — l. 

Thus the assumption that there is a finite number of integers of 
form 4k — 1 produces a contradiction. Hence the number of primes 
in the given sequence must be infinite. 

The proof for the second sequence, which contains all the integers 
of form 6k — 1, is quite analogous. 

(b) The proof of this problem is based on the same idea as 
that just presented in part (a). Assume that the sequence 5, 9, 13, 
17, 21, 25, • • ■ contains only a finite number of primes: 5, 13, 17, ■ ■ ■, 
pn* Consider the number 

N= (5-13-17---/0 2 + 1 . 

The number N is clearly not a perfect square (it is one more than 
a square). However, N is the sum of two squares; from problem 
247 (b) it follows that N can only be of form 4& + 1 (no number of 
form 4k — \ can be expressed as the sum of two squares). From 
this point the method of proof is analogous to that used in problem 
253 or 254 (a). 

(c) The proof is somewhat more complicated than the proofs 
of parts (a) and (b), although it is still based on the same idea. 

Assume that in the sequence 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, *■ ■ there exists 
only a finite number of primes: 


11,31,41,61, .

Some Problems in Number Theory 


Consider the integer N = (11-31-41-61- • -p n y — 1. This number is 
relatively prime to all the integers 11,31,41, ,p n , since N + 1 is 
divisible by all these integers. We shall designate the product 
11-31-41 by a. Then 

N - a 3 — \ = (a — 1 )(a 4 + a 3 + a 1 + a + 1) . 

Let us investigate what factorization of N can produce a factor of 
a 4 + a 3 + a 1 + a + 1. Clearly, a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 is not divisible by 
2 (it is the sum of five odd numbers). Further, a 4 + a* + a 1 + a + 1 
is divisible by 5, inasmuch as a itself terminates in the digit 1 (a is 
a product of numbers all ending with 1; a 2 ,a 3 f and a 4 each end with 
the digit 1, and so the sum a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 ends with the digit 
5). Now let p be a prime divisor of a 4 + a 3 + a 1 + a + 1 differing from 
5. Here, a — 1 cannot be divisible by p y since otherwise a would be 
of form kp + 1, and so a 2 , a 3 , and a 4 (which are equal, respectively, 
to (kp + l) 2 , (kp + l) 3 , and (kp + l) 4 ) would be of the same form, and 
the number 

a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 = (kp + l) 4 + (kp + l) 3 + (kp + l) 2 + (kp + 1) + 1 

would yield a remainder of 5 upon division by p. It follows that 
p — 1 must be divisible by 5; in fact, suppose that p — 1 yields the 
remainder 4 when divided by 5: 

p - l = 56 + 4 . 

We note (Fermat's theorem, problem 240) that a p ~ l — 1 is divisible 
by p. But in this case 

a”~ l - 1 = a 3k+A - 1 = a*(a 3k - 1) + (a 4 - 1) , 

and since a 3k — 1 = (a 3 ) k — 1* is divisible by a 3 — 1, which means that 
it is divisible also by p f it follows that a 4 ~ 1 is divisible by />. 
However, 

a b — 1 = a(a 4 — 1) + (a — 1) ; 

consequently, if a 3 — 1 and a 4 — 1 are divisible by p , then a — 1 also 
must be divisible by p . This, as shown above, is impossible. It 
may be shown, in analogous fashion, that p — 1 cannot yield the 
remainders 1,2, or 3 upon division by 5. 

Thus, p — 1 is divisible by 5 and is an even number (p being odd). 
Consequently, ^ — 1 is divisible by 10, which means that p is of form 
106 + 1; that is, it belongs to the given progression. Therefore, it is 
established that the prime divisors of the number a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 
can be only 5 and prime numbers of form 106 + 1. 


Solutions (255-256)

However, the number a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 is obviously larger than 
5, and it is not divisible by 5 2 = 25. In fact, the integer a ends with 
the digit 1 and is consequently of form 56 + 1. Further, by the 
binomial theorem, we have 

a 4 + a 3 + a 2 + a + 1 

= (5k + l) 4 + (5k + l) 3 + (5k + l) 2 + 56 + 1 + 1 
= 625k 4 + 4* 125& 3 + 6 ■ 25& 2 + 4-5£ + 1 
+ 125k 3 + 3 • 25& 2 + 3*56 + 1 
+ 256 2 + 2*56 + 1+56+1 + 1 
= 625k 4 + 5 * 1256 3 + 10-256 2 + 10*56 + 5 
= 5* [5(256 4 + 256 3 + 106 2 + 26) + 1] . 

It follows that this number, and, consequently, N=a 3 — \ y must 
have at least one prime divisor of form 10* + 1. But, as noted above, 
N is relatively prime to all prime numbers of form 106 + 1. This 
contradiction proves the theorem. 

Remark'. We note that this proof, almost as it stands, will allow us to 
prove that any infinite arithmetic progression consisting of integers of form 
2 pk + 1, where p is an odd prime, contains an infinite number of primes. 

255. (a) Let a and b be adjacent sides of a rectangle; then its 
perimeter is P — 2 (a + b) and its area is S = ab. From the so-called 

theorem of the geometric and arithmetic means [that is, ab ^ I 

see the discussion of Section 11 (Problems)], we have 


It is obvious that the area S will be maximal when ^ in this ex¬ 
pression represents equality; this happens only for a — b. Therefore, 
of all rectangles having the given perimeter P, the rectangle of 
greatest area will be a square. 

(b) The solution is analogous to that of part (a), except here 
S is fixed and P becomes least when a = b.

261. Let the lengths of the two beams of the scale be a and b , 
respectively. Then in order to balance a weight of 1 pound placed 
in one of the pans—say on the pan hung from the beam of length 
a— the butcher must place in the other pan an amount of meat 

weighing actually x — - 7 - pounds (since the moments a-1 and b-x 
b 

must be equal in order to produce equilibrium). Similarly, if a one- 
pound weight is placed on the other pan, it will be balanced by 

— pounds of meat. Therefore, the butcher gives out + — pounds

376 


Inequalities 


On the other hand, suppose the butcher sells his meat in the following way: 
A given piece is divided into two equal parts, and each part is weighed on a 
different pan. Let us assume (since other cases can be easily handled by si¬ 
milar reasoning) that the true weight of the whole is exactly 2 pounds; thus, 
each piece has true weight, by assumption, of 1 pound. When one piece of 
meat is placed on one of the pans, the total of the weights needed to balance 

it comes to ~r- pounds, and when the other piece is placed on the other pan, 
b 

the total of the weights needed to balance that piece comes to — pounds. 

a 

Thus in this case, the sum of the markings on the weights exceeds the total 
weight of the meat—that is the butcher is short-weighing his customers. 

Thus, whether the customer gains or the butcher gains depends upon the 
procedure used. The reader is invited to answer the equestion: Is a paradox 
involved here? [Editor.]

The equality sign is obtained only if all three differences 

VT-VT, 

VT -VT, 

VT-VT 

are zero, which happens only when a = b = c. 

264. By Heron’s formula, the area of a triangle having sides a, b, c, 
is equal to 

S = Vp(p ~ TiP - b)(p — c) 

= VT- VlP - a)(p - b)(p- cj ,

which yields the greatest possible area for the triangle.

268. There exist many proofs of this theorem, some of them not 
elementary. In view of the importance of this theorem, three different 
elementary proofs will be given. The first will be based on the re¬ 
sult of problem 267, and the second and third will use mathematical 
induction. 

First Proof. We show first that if the statement of the theorem 
concerning arithmetic and geometric means holds for n + 1 positive 
numbers, then it holds for n positive numbers. Assume that for 
any set of n + 1 positive numbers a u a 2 , ■■*,#*, dn +l

But in view of the result of the preceding problem we know that 
the theorem of arithmetic and geometric means holds for arbitrarily 
large integers, in particular, for integers of form 2 m . Therefore, the 
theorem holds for arbitrary «, since given any n it is dominated by 
some number 2 m , and, by what has just been shown, the theorem 
holds for 2 m — 1 , 2 m — 2, and so on, and thus for n . 

Also, if for n + 1 numbers equality holds only if all the numbers 
are equal, then the same condition must clearly hold for n numbers. 
Since this condition for equality was shown necessary in problem 
267 for n — 2 m , it also applies in this problem. 

Remark: This method of proof, which somewhat resembles that of mathe¬ 
matical induction, is sometimes called transfinite induction. It may be stated 
as follows; if the truth of the theorem for n = k + 1 implies that it holds for 
n = k, and if, no matter what positive integer n is chosen, the theorem can 
always be demonstrated for some integer exceeding n, then the theorem holds 
for all natural numbers n. 

Second Proof (mathematical induction). For n = 2, we have 

a i + a 2 ^ / - 

—2 -^ Va,a z 

Assume that the inequality of the problem has been proved for some 
number n of positive numbers; we shall show that it must hold for 
n + 1 positive numbers. Let a lt a 2 , ■ • a ni a n+l be n + 1 positive 
numbers, arranged such that a n+l is the largest. Since 

a n +i #i , 

Oyi+i ^ a Zi * *', a n +i = Oyi , 

it follows that

Since, by the induction assumption, the inequality holds for n num- 
bers, that is, 

(AnY ^ « 1 « 2 * * > 

it follows that 

(An+i )^ 1 ^ (An) n a n+ i ^ a x a Z ' • , 

and, consequently, 

Ayf+i = \/a\a z * * * an+ 1 • 

Now, if not all the numbers are equal, then b > 0, and the strict 
inequality holds. 

Third Solution (mathematical induction ). Designate a x by b\ f and so 
on; then the inequality whose proof we seek takes on the form 

bi T b z T * *' T bn = nb\b z • • • bn ■ 

Suppose that this inequality is assumed to hold for any n positive

But by the induction hypothesis,

Hence it suffices to show that

or, designating n V / c l c 2 - * * c n by k t that 

(m + \)k n — 1 ^ nk n+l . 

The last inequality follows from the following computation: 

(n + 1)£* — 1 — nk n+i — —nk n (k — 1) + (k n — 1) 

= (k — 1 )(—nk n + k n ~ l + k n ~ 2 H- b k + 1)

(for k > 0, the expression in brackets is clearly positive). 

The final inequality shown reduces to equality for k — 1. Mathe¬ 
matical induction may be employed to show that equality will hold 
only if 

C\ — C 2 — — * — Cn = 1 I 

that is, if

Remark : Other proofs may be found in the volumes referred to at the be¬

Littlewood, and Polya. Moreover, the inequality of this problem is easily es¬ 
tablished from the results of problem 269 (a) and (b) and problem 270, provided 
problem 268 is not used to establish it. (See, for example, the second proof 
of problem 269 (a) and (b).

xi which preserve the arithmetic mean: 

X[ + Xj + Xj H-hXn-i + Xn _ ^ 


To do this, we can set 


Xn — A , 

xi = X 1 + (x n — Xn) . 


In the product x t x t ---Xn all the factors except the first and last are 
left unchanged; we shall show that the product x[xi exceeds XiX n :

We designate - x' n by t; then x f n = x n - t and xl = x x + /. We 
have 

*U! = (x H - /)(*i + /) = X n Xi + (jit* - *i) t - / 2 . 

But since = A > * 1( we have 

x n - x { > x n - Xn = t , 

from which we obtain 

(x n - Xt) - t > 0 , 

(x n — xi)t — t 2 > 0 , 

and, consequently, 

= *n*i + (*» - Xi)t - t 2 > . 

If the new set x{, x 2 , x 3t '-- t Xn- u A is now not yet composed of 
equal numbers, then, arranging them again in increasing order, we 
may repeat the previous procedure to find a new set whose sum is 
the same but whose product is greater: In this new sequence at 
least two of the numbers will be equal to A. Repetition of this 
reasoning must finally produce a set all of whose elements are the 
number A.

If a = l y the last exponent shown above is 1, and the expression on 
the right becomes 



The statement of the problem immediately follows. 

278 . The expression (1 — * 5 (1 + x)(l + 2 a :)) 2 is negative for |*|> 1 , 
and is positive for | x \ < 1. In fact, 

(1 - x)Kl + *)(1 + 2a:) 2 = (1 - x)K 1 - a: 2 )(1 + 2a:) 2 . 

The first and third factors on the right are always positive for 
x + 1, and the second factor is positive or negative, respectively, 
depending upon whether \x \ <lor \ x \ > 1 . Accordingly, we shall 
consider only values of x such that | x | < 1. We now use the theo¬ 
rem of arithmetic and geometric means on the five factors 1 — x, the 
single factor 1 + x r and the two factors 1 + 2 a:: 

(1 - xY(l + x)(l + 2 a:) 2

U + l +2 ) 

The right side of this inequality is independent of the value assigned 
to x . Hence, the left side will be maximal for that value of x which 
makes all the factors equal. The only value of x which will accom¬ 


Solutions {277-279)

plish this is X = 0. Then for this value of x the given product 
reaches its maximal value 1. 

279. Let r be the radius of the circle; designate the known length 
OM by a, and the unknown length ON by x (Figure 27). Then we 
can write: 

MN = x — a , 

NQ = vV - x 2 , 

and, consequently, the squared area of the rectangle is equal to 

4(x — a) 2 (x 2 — x 2 ) . 



We must determine for which value of x this expression is maxi¬ 
mal. We rewrite our product in the form 

+-[(x - a)-(x - a)-a(r - x)-&(r + x)] , 
a# 

where a and (3 are chosen such that the sum of the factors in the 
brackets, that is, 

(x — a) + (x — a) + air — x) + @(r + x) 

= (2 - a + &)x + {a + &) r - 2a , 

will be independent of x (such that a — 0 = 2). 

The product (1) attains its maximal value if 

a(r - x) = + x) = x - a 


[see the solution of problem 269 (a)]. But the equation cAr - x) = 
0 (r + x) implies that

(the positive sign is taken for the root, since * > 0). 

The segment of length x, and hence the rectangle sought, can be 
constructed using ruler and compass. 

280. The volume of the box is equal to 

(2a - 2b) 2 -b = 4b(a - b) 2 . 

We can write the right member of this equality in the form 

b-a(a - b )• a(a - b)] , 

and we shall select a such that the sum of the factors within the 
brackets, that is, 

b + 2a(a -b) = 2aa + (1 - 2 a)b , 
does not depend upon b ^we take a = . 

The maximal value of the product (1) [see the solution of problem 
269 (a)] is obtained when 

b = a(a — b) . 


Thus, we find

281. (a) The inequality of this problem has the same relationship 
to inequality (2') in the discussion of § 11 (problems) as does the theo¬ 
rem of arithmetic and geometric means (problem 268) to inequality 
(2) of that discussion. A proof of this is possible in any one of 
several ways, all of them analogous to the proofs given for problem 
268. 

The solution here will be analogous to the first solution of problem 
268. Inasmuch as

Continuation of this process enables us to prove the theorem for 2 m

It is easily established that equality holds only if ay = a 2 = ■ • ■ = 

(b) The validity of the inequality will first be established 
for two numbers; that is, we shall establish that

For k = 2 this inequality has already been proved [see (l 1 ) of the

from which it follows that the inequality holds for k + 1. By the 
principle of mathematical induction, the proposition holds for all 
natural numbers. The remainder of the proof follows as in (a).

Taking the — > 0 power of both sides produces the desired result. 

The case in which a < 0 is proved in a similar manner (see the 
solution to problem 270). 

283. If a and 0 are of different sign, the theorem of power means 
follows from the result of problem 282. Hence we shall investigate 
only the case in which a and 0 have the same sign. Assume now 
that 0 < a < £. Designate Sp(a) by K , and divide both sides of the

285. A proof by induction will be given. It will be convenient to 
introduce a special designation for (the arithmetic mean of all 
possible products of the n numbers a u a 2y an taken k at a time); 
this summation will be designated as P k . The inequality we wish 
to prove may then be written 

For convenience we also introduce the notation P 0 (a), which will be 
taken equal to 1. 

The inequality is obviously true if there are only two numbers, a x 
and a 2 . In fact, in this case there are only three expressions P k (a): 

PM = l, 


Pz(a) = a,a 2 , 

and the inequality assumes the form 

PM 2 > PMPM = Pz(a) , 


or 



a& 2 


(which we have already encountered). 

Assume now that the inequality has been established for n — 1 
positive numbers a lt a 2y we shall show that the inequality 

must also be valid for n positive numbers a u a 2f ,a n . Designate 
the sum of all the possible products of the n numbers, taken k at a 
time, by S k (a) r and the sum of the products of the n — 1 numbers 
a it a 2 taken k at a time, by S k (a), If we factor a n out of 

each term of S k (a) which contains this number, we derive the iden¬ 
tity 

S k (a) = S k (a) -I- a n S k ~M . 


Further, let us write P k to designate the /^-expressions for the

Then we see that the symmetric mean I 2 of tfi^numbers a u a 2t and

It follows, by reasoning analogous to 


that used for problem 287, that

(b) tanf.tan|-tan-^g (^) 2 = ^l. 

In both cases, equality holds only if a — $ = r = 60°. 

289. The Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality is of sufficient importance 
to justify the giving of four proofs of its validity. 

First Proof . We can write 

(xai + bi) 2 + ( xa 2 + b 2 ) 2 + * • * + ( xa n + b n ) 2 
— (x 2 a\ -K 2iXG\b\ + bi) 

+ (x 2 a 2 + 2xa 2 b 2 + 62 ) + * * • -\-(x 2 an + 2 xa n b n + bn) 

= Ax 2 -K 2 Bx + C , 

where 

A = a\ + ^2 + * • ■ , 

B = + a 2 b 2 + • ■ ■ ~\~a„b n , 

c = 65 + *| + • •. +&* 2 . 

The left member of this equation is, as a sum of squares, non- 

negative for all x; in particular, it is non-negative for x — -- . 

Substitution of this value for x in the equation yields 

A B1 2B B i 

A 2 A A 

Since A > 0, AC — B 2 ^ 0, or B 2 ^ AC. 

We obtain the inequality sought by substituting for A, B , and C 
their expressions in terms of at and bi. 

The equality sign is possible only if 

xa x + bi = xa 2 + b 2 = xa % + = * * * = x &n + b n = 0 , 

from which we find 

-^- = — = — x).

Second Proof . Given two numbers a and 6 , we have (a — 6) 2 ^ 0, 
or a 2 + b 2 ^ 2ab , and so

If we add these together, we arrive at

Substitution of the appropriate quantities for and bi yields 


a\b\ + ■ * ■ -\-a n b n = AB , 

(*A + • ■ ■ + a n b n f < (a] + ■ * ■ + al)(b\ + • * * +bl) , 

which is what we wished to prove. 

Equality holds only if

which implies 


h = h = ... = h( = B\ m 

fli a 2 a n \ A) 


Third Proof. The inequality holds, trivially, for n = 1; that is, 

(a.*.) 2 g a\b\. 








400 Inequalities 

We shall show that if the inequality is assumed to hold for n pairs 
of numbers, that is, 

C 2 ^ AB, 

where 

A = a\ + a\+--+al, 

£ = 6; + « + ---+«, 

C = aj)\ -\- dzbz * * * ■+■ Qnbn t 
then it must hold also for n + 1 pairs of numbers: 

(C + a n +ib n+i) 2 ~ (A + fin + i)(i? + ^«fl) . 

In fact, we can write 

(A + al+i)(B + &n+i) — (C + An+l^nfl) 2 
= AB -h Abn+i "h Ba n +i -h fin+i^«+i C 2 2Ca n +ib n +i 

(fin+ lb n + 1) 2 

— (AB — C) + ( Abn+i + Bal+i — 2Ca n +ib n +i ) 

= (AB - C) + (V"Ab n+l - VB~a n ^r 
+ 2(VAB- VC*)a n+i b n+l ^ 0 

(since each of the three terms is equal to or greater than zero). 

Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the inequality 
is valid for all natural numbers n. 

The equality sign holds only if 

fii a% dn 

b\ bz bn 

Fourth Proof . It can be proved by mathematical induction that 

(s «*Y Y=-fs s («*&« - ■ 

\k =i /\k =i / \t=i / M-H4 

The right member of this inequality is nonnegative and vanishes 
only in the event of equality of the ratios a k .b k . If this expression 
is not zero, we have 

(s «*)(i> a ) -(£ a > b f > 0 . 

which proves the theorem.

which yields the result sought. The equality sign holds only if a, = 

dz — * * * fin- 

291. By the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality we have 

(dr 1 + fl2-l +■*•+ fin*l) 2 

S (fil + fi2 H-- + fin) (1 + 1 + *-1" 1) > 

from which we obtain 

/ fii + fl 2 H-1~ fin V < fii + al H-h fin 

V n ) = n 

The equality holds only for fii = fi 2 — fin . 

292. In the solution of problem 288 it was shown that 

tan (f ) tan (f) + tan ( f) tan (f ) + tan (f ) tan (f ) = 1 • 

By the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality, we can write 

[t»n’(f) + «■>•(-§) + tan*(f )][«n , (l) + «>'' , (|)+ ta "‘(lf)] 

* [ tan (f) ,an (f) + tan Of) tan (i) +,an (i) tan (fj] ’ 11 

from which the desired result follows. 

Equality can hold only for a = 0 = r = 60°. 

293. We can write the following expansion: 

(x, + y,) 2 + ••• + (*» + >n) 2 = (*. + 

+ • • • +(*„ + y n )x . + (*i + y.)yi + ■ • • +(*» + y*)y» • 

Let us make the following substitutions in the Cauchy-Buniakowski 
inequality: 

X l + yi = fii, * ■ • , Xn + yn = fin , 

Xi = * ' * > Xn — bn • 

The following inequality is then valid:

Inequalities 


(*1 + yC)Xl H-h (Xn + y n )Xn 

< [(* + y0 2 + * • ■ + (Xn + y n ) 2 ) l/2 [xl + • ■ * + xl}^ . 
Analogously, we have 

(xi + yOyi +- \-(x n + y n )y n 

^ [(* + yi) 2 +••• + (*.+ y«) 2 ] 1/2 [yi 2 + * • * +yl ] l/2 . 

If we combine these two inequalities, we obtain 

(*i + yi) 2 + * * * + (x n + y„) 2 

^[(xi +yi) 2 H- \- (x n + y„) 2 ] 1/2 

x [(xl + • • • + £)'** + (y? + • • ■ +yn) 1/2 ]. 

If both members of this last inequality are divided by 

[(*1 + ^l) 2 +■■•+(*.+ ^n) 2 ] 1/2 , 

we obtain 

l/( X\ + yi) 2 + • * * + (x n + y n ) 2 

^ +-..+X. 1 + Vyi+"- + yl , 

which is what we set out to prove. 

The equality can hold only if - = .

294. The Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality yields 

4Q 2 = (a r a 2 + fl 2 fli + a L a 3 + fl 3 fli H-bfl»-ifln + a n a n - 1) 2 

^ (fli + a\ -b fl? -b • • • + flu) (fla + fl 2 + fl 2 + ■ ■ • + fln-0 

= (w - l)P-(w - 1)P, 

from which the result immediately follows. 

We have equality only if fli = fl 2 = ■ ■ -fl n . 

295. From the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality, we can write 

(.VK- i/m +VTi-VT*x 2 + ■■• +VK- Vplxnf 
< (i/tf + V& +■ • • + VJ n )(Vfi x? 

+ l//>| *2 H-H l//)J x.) . 

The equality sign can be used only if *1 = x 2 = • ■ • = x n . 

296. We make the following substitutions in the inequality of 
problem 295: 


Solutions ( 294-299 ) 


403 



We then have 

1 1 1 V / 1 1 1 V 1 2 1 2 1 2 \ 

T Xl + T Xi + T x ') ~ \T + T + TA~ 2 Xi + J Xl + T x y- 

The equality can hold only for equality of the ratios 



297 . This inequality is merely a restatement, in another notation, 
of the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality. In fact, if we substitute in 
the latter a\ — Xk and b\ = y* f and take the square root of both sides, 
we obtain the inequality of the problem. 

298 . By two applications of the Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality, 
first to the pairs aj) u a 2 b 2 , ,a n b n and Cid it c 2 d 2} ,c n d nt and then 
to the squares of the numbers a u a 2 , ■ • •, a n> b t , b 2f ■ • •, b n ; c u c 2f • • *, 
Cn\ d u d 2t • • ■, dn> we obtain 

(flAci^i + a 2 b 2 c 2 d 2 + • • • + Unb-nCndri)*

Equality holds only if 

au b\\ C\. d\ — a 2 : b 2 \ c 2 \ d 2 = * ■ ■ = a n * b n \ c n • d n . 

299 . We shall rearrange the in nondecreasing order, assuming 
(renumbering if necessary) that 

fli ^ a 2 ^ fl 3 ^ ^ fl n . 


Now we may consider the bi to be in nonincreasing order; that is, 
we assume that 

b, ^ b 2 ^ b 2 £ * ■ * ^ b n . 

[Once we have rearranged the fli and written the given fraction

if bi < bj f for i < j, for any z, an interchange of these two b within 
the fraction can only increase its value, inasmuch as the value of the 
numerator will remain unaltered, but the denominator will become 
less (we will have supplied a greater Ui with a lesser hi factor; con¬ 
sider the difference 

Aft + ajbi) - (aibi + c;ft) = (a { - c,-)(ft - ft) < 0)] . 

Now, in the event that all c» are equal and all bi are equal, the 
fraction has a value of 1. Hence we may assume that either not 
all the c,- are equal or else not all the bi are the same (or both). 
Let us write the system: 

a\ - a { a\ + ftc i , 

% = <*& + &% (i* = 2,3, 

This system may be solved for a { and ft:

Accordingly, a* ^ 0, and ft ^ 0 . Now, = 0 only if

bi = ft. , 

ft = l, 
ft = 0 


if c* = Ci, ft = ft, = 1. 

We introduce the terminology 


02 + ft + * ’ 4 + ft-1 + 1 — B . 


Then the numerator of the fraction of the problem can be rewritten 
in the form 

(Aal + Bal){Ab\ + Bbl) . 

As for the denominator of the given fraction, we shall use the 
Cauchy-Buniakowski inequality Aft + cA) 2 ^ (cf + a\) (b\ + b\) (see 
the discussion immediately following problem 288) to obtain

^ ouaA + ftcA . 


If the inequalities of (i) are added, for i— 1, 2, 3, ■ • •, n — 1, n (here 
we assume ai = 1, ft = 0 and a n = 0, ft — 1), we obtain 

Cift + a 2 b z + • ■ • + a n b n ^ AcA + Ba n b n . 

Thus, the given fraction does not exceed 

(Ad] + Bal)(Ab\ + Bbl)

However,

In view of the theorem of arithmetic and geometric means, we have

Inequality (1) cannot become an equality for positive numbers, 
S * nCe ~a^~b' ^ ence Possibility exists only if all are zero or 
1 (in the latter case, ft = 0 ), that is, if 

ai = a 2 = • • • —a k < a k+l = a k+2 = • • - = a n , 
bi = b 2 = • • * = bk > b k+l = b k+l = • ■ ■ —b n . 

Then for ( 2) to become an equality it is necessary that

that is, 

ka L bi = (« — k)a n b n ,

Remark : This result can be derived from the inequality of Cauchy-Bunia-

303. Two proofs will be given for this inequality, which has frequent 
application in analysis. 

First Proof . If we substitute into the inequality of problem 302

and, further, 

fli = xf, «2 = xl , • * •, a n = xi ; 
fti = yl b * = yl, * * ■ ft* = .y! , 

we obtain Holder's inequality. 

We arrive at equality only if x t : y x = jc 2 : _y 2 = ■ ■ ■ = x n : y n . 

Second Proof . We write 

(*? + *? + = 

(y!+y?+*-* + y2)^ = T, 

and divide both members of the inequality by XY. If we use the 
terminology, 


Solutions ( 303-304 )

j* = t k (* = 1 , 2 , 

then the inequality we are considering becomes equivalent to

where the following conditions are to hold: 

z\ + zl+--- + zl = 1 , 

ti+ ti +•■• + *; = i. ( 2 ) 

By using the inequality of problem 301, we can write the n inequa- 
lities:

Now, using condition (2), and the fact that ~ = ^ 7 we °^ ta ^ n 
inequality ( 1 ), which is equivalent to that of the problem. 

The equality holds only if 

*i- y\ — *2* y 2 = • * * —Xn- . 

304. The proof is analogous to that of problem 302. We write

If this identity is applied to the difference (n + 1 )* - n k , we have

H-f ~(n -f- 1 )n k ~ 2 + n k ~ l = k-n k ~ l H-, 

where the dots designate only terms of less than (k — 1 ) st degree in 
n. These terms can not increase the order of the sequence; it fol¬ 
lows that the order of the sequence u ( n l) = u n +i — u n is equal to k—l:

(b) Upon transition from the sequence uh s) to the sequence 
the order of the sequence is decreased by 1. Therefore uh k) is a 
sequence of zero order; that is, all the elements of the sequence u { n k) 
are the same number. This means that = 0 for all n, which is 
what we wished to show. 

Remark : It also follows from the solution of this problem that a sequence 
of order k has sequences of first-order, second-order, and so on, differences, 
up to the kth order, which do not include a sequence all of whose terms vanish 
[that is, + is the first difference sequence comprising all zeros]. In fact, 
a sequence of differences of s-order of the sequence, where 3 < k, is a sequence 
of order k — s whose terms cannot all reduce to 0 (a polynomial of degree k — s 
can have value 0 for not more than k — s values of its variable). See problem 
310 for the sequence of differences of order k. 

310. First Solution. In the solution of problem 309 (a) we saw 

that if u n = a 0 n k + a v n k ~ l H-h a k is a sequence of order k , then u »* 

is a sequence of order k — 1 of form uh l) = a Q kn k ~ l H-. It follows 

that the sequence wl 2) has the form 

u {2) = a Q k(k - l)n k ~ 2 + •••, 
the sequence wl 3) has the form 

u ( f =a 0 k(k- l)(*-2 )«*- 3 + — ; 
and so on. Finally, the sequence ul k ~ l) has the form 
a 0 k(k — 1) • * • 2 ■«+•••, 

where the final dots indicate only a constant. The assertion of the 
problem follows at once. 

Second Solution. By problem 309 (a), the sequence of differences of 
kth order of the sequence of degree k is of zero order, that is, all 
terms are the same, independent of n . Hence it suffices to determine 

uT. 

For u n we have the formula 

U n = Uq + C l n Uo l) + * • * + CnU^ 

(see problem 313). Equating this with the given polynomial, we have 

fio n k + fii??*" 1 + • * * + Ok — Uo + Chu { Q l) + * * * -\~CnUo k) . 

The two members of this equation represent the same polynomial 
in n; but it is necessary to expand the C’s on the right to enable 
comparison of the coefficients of like-degree terms. The term a 0 n k t 
however, can be obtained from the term C k u [ a k) alone:

The coefficient of n k is equal to Uo k) /k\. Equating the coefficients for 
nk on both sides, we obtain 


from which we obtain 


Uo k) = a 0 -kl 


311. (a) We shall write the sum-sequence in the triangular form 
explained in the introduction preceding problem 309; each u will be 
the sum of the two elements flanking it in the previous line: 


J 7 (l> „-;U> jrll) -U) 

Uq U\ Ui Ms 

r A2) — ( 2 ) -( 2 ) 

Uq U\ My l 


u {k) u[ k) uL ui k) - 


Note that uh k) depends only upon w„, u n + i, ■ * *, u n+k and not upon any 
other numbers of the initial sequence comprising the first row. We 
shall now show by mathematical induction that 

Un ] — C\u n + CkUn+l + CfcWn + 2 + * * ’ + CkU n +k . 

The formula is valid for k = 1, since here it assumes the form 

Un C\Un “h C\Un+l — Un “1“ Wn + 1 > 

which, by definition, is obvious. Now, assume the formula is valid 
for k — 1; we shall show that validity for k is implied: 

r Ak) __ —(* — 11 , — (fc —1) 

U n — U n i Wn + 1 

(Ck — \U n “1“ Ck — lWn+i "t - Cjc — iWn+2 “1“ * * * “h Ck — lWn+Jfe-1) 

“h (Ck — lWn+l “1“ Ck — lWn + 2 ""h Ck — lWn+3 “1“ * * * “1“ Ck — lMn+k)

+ * * * + (Ck-l + Ck-\)U n + k-l + Cfc-iWn + t . 

From the definition of the symbol C”, it follows that 

C O yr'iO 

k-\ — Cjfe , 

cU + Cl-, = cl , 

CL, + cl-1 = cl,

and so on. Therefore, 

U ik) — CkUn + Ciw,+ I + * ■ • + Ck l U n +k-i + CkUn + k , 

which is what we set out to prove. 

(b) The proof here is entirely analogous to that of problem 
(a) and is left for the reader. 

312. The proof will be given by mathematical induction. (Refer 
to the terminology of the Pascal Triangle in the introduction to this 
series of problems.). The proposition holds for k = 1 ; that is, C\ = 

in the first row of the triangular array. 

Assume validity for the (n — 1) st row; we must show that this 
holds for the wth row. From the definition of the Pascal triangle, 
we have 

a = cl= 1 + CL, . 

Therefore, for k > 1 , we have 

* _ (n - 1 )(n - 2 )■■•(* - k + 1 ) (n - 1 )(n - 2 )■■■(« - k) 
Cn " (k-\)\ k\ 

We can write this in the form 

k (n - 1 )(n - 2 )- --(n-k + 1) ( n - k \ 

Cn ~ (A-l)! V + k ) 

— n ( n ~~ 1 )(” ~~ 2 )- • '(n — k + 1 ) 
k\ 

which is the desired result. 

If k — 1, then we have 

Cl = Cn- t + Ci-i = 1 + (n - 1 ) = n . 

Remark : It follows from this formula that the numbers standing in the 
(k + 1) st row of Pascal's triangle, are of degree k in n. In fact, if we take 
k fixed and let n vary, then 

k _ n(n — 1) • • - (n - k + 1) 

Gn “ k\ 

is a polynomial in n of degree k . 


313. It suffices here to note that the number triangle

where k is any positive integer. 


316. (a) The first row of differences of the sequence 
U n = 1* + 2* + 3* H- + n k , 

such that all members of the (ft + l)st row vanish, is the sequence 
of kth degree polynomials (n + 1)*. This means that m„ • 

tne initial sequence provides k + 1 sequences of differences e ore 
the zero row is reached, then it must have been of (k + l)st order, 
that is, of (k + l)st degree in «(see problem 314).

summation of 

u k = l k + 2 * + 3* + • • • + n k . 

Determining the coefficient of n k is more involved. We refer to 
the formula derived in problem 313: 

u n = a Q n k + a x n k ~ l H-b a k 

= u 0 + cWo" +--- + C k n -w 0 k ~ l) +cWo k> .

(compare with the second solution of problem 310). Now, applying

317. If a 0 = 1, the problem has a simple solution. It was shown 
in problem 310 that in this case the integers of the 6 th row of dif¬ 
ferences were equal to 6 !. If all the numbers of a given row are 
divisible by d, then the numbers of all successive rows are divisible 
by d. Therefore, 6 ! is divisible by d.

It follows that the integers a 0f a u ♦ • *, 0 * are all divisible by di. Now,

(A) Divide N coins into two sets, X ana Y: it is understood that

it is light; and if it is in set Y, it is heavy. Then if N ^ 3 n , the

x, p — b = y, and p — c — 2 , where a , b , and c are the sides of the 
triangle and p is its semi-perimeter. Then the problem reduces to 

the solution in integers of xyz = 4(x + y + 2 ),or x = . Assum- 

yz — 4 

ing x ^ y, we can investigate the squared inequality in y (with coef¬ 
ficients in terms of 2 ); this enables us to found bounds for 2 and y. 

Answer: The sides of the triangle can be equal to 6, 25, 29; 7, 15, 
20; 9, 10, 17; 5, 12, 13; or 6, 8, 10 (all five solutions). 

128. (a) The problems lead to the solution of the equation x 2 +y 2 = 

2 2 . If x, y, and 2 are not relatively prime, then the equation can be 
divided through by the greatest common factor; hence we may con¬ 
sider the case for which x, y, and 2 are pairwise relatively prime. 
Then 2 is odd, and one of x or y is even and the other odd. Write 
the equation in the form = z ^ y and use the fact that 

—- and — are relatively prime. 

Answer : x = 2 tab, y = t{a 2 — b 2 ) f z = t{a 2 + b 2 ), where a and b are 


Answers ( 129-135) 


arbitrary relatively prime numbers (a > b), and t is any natural 
number. 

(b) The problem leads to the solution in integers of the equa¬ 
tion z 2 = x 2 + y 2 — xy, or [4 z + (x + y)] 2 = [2x + 2(x + y)] 2 + [3(x—_y)] 2 . 
Now use the result of problem (a). 


Answer : x = tb(2a 


a), z = — / ( a 2 + — «&) 


where a and b are relatively prime < & < 2a^, and at least one 

of the numbers t or a + b is divisible by 3; otherwise, / is arbitrary, 
(c) The solution is analogous to that of problem (b). 

Answer : x = ta(a — 2b), y — tb(2a — b),z = t(a 2 + b 2 — ab), where a 
and b are relatively prime (a > 2b), and at least one of the numbers 
t or a + b is divisible by 3.

246. Use Wilson's theorem (problem 245). The conditions of the 
problem are satisfied by the number x ~{ ^ 2 

247. (a) Show that the product ( a 2 + b 2 )(a\ + &?) can be represented 
as the sum of the squares of two polynomials. 

(b) Prove that if the product mp, where p is a prime number, 
and m is not 1 and is less than />, can be represented as a sum of 
squares of two integers, then m can be reduced by some factor. That 
is, a number n < m can be found such that np also can be repre¬ 
sented as a sum of squares of two integers. Also, use the proposition 
of problem 246. 

(c) Use the results of parts (a) and (b) and the proposition 
given in the hint to part (b). 

248. Prove that for every odd prime number p it is possible to 

find two numbers x and v, each less than—, such that x 2 and — y 2 — 1 

Q 

yield the same remainder upon division by p. 

249. (a) Show that the product 

(x‘i + xl + xl + x5)(yl + y\ + yl + y]) 

can be represented as a sum of squares of four polynomials. 

(b) The solution is similar to that of problem 247 (see the 
hint to that problem). Instead of using the proposition of problem 
246 in that solution, we must use that of problem 248. 

250. Investigate what remainders can be obtained when the sum 
of three squares is divided by 8. 

251. First, show that if a number is representable as the sum of 
four squares of integers, then six times its square can be represent¬

ed as the sum of twelve fourth powers of integers. Further, use 
the fact that every integer yields a remainder of at most 5 when 
divided by 6 , and apply twice the theorem of problem 249 (b). 

252. The idea of the solution is as follows. It is necessary to 
find some solution in positive rational numbers for the equation 

x z T _y 3 + z 3 = a , 

where a is a given rational number. We have here one equation and 
three unknowns. If we assume that two of these unknowns are 
functionally related in some way, then the equation may be greatly 
simplified—for example, if we let y = - 2 , then we have simply x z = a . 
From the simplified equation it is sometimes possible to express one 
of the unknowns in terms of a ; in this instance, for example, we 
obtained x — fyli. Here x is irrational, which will generally be the 
case with such a procedure. We must try to find a functional de¬ 
pendence between two of the unknowns such that the third unknown 
comes out of the simplified equation with rational value (without the 
radical). If this can be done, it remains only to find suitable rational 
solutions for the two other unknowns, and these are related by the 
function which was set up between them. To do this, it is conveni¬ 
ent to change the unknowns x,y, and 2 to new unknowns. For the 
determination of the new variables, it is useful to begin with the 
identity of problem 162 (b). 

253. Let pi,p 2t * ■ ■, pn be n primes. Find an integer not divisible 
by any of these primes and larger than any of them.

Find an integer of form 4 n — 1 (or 6n — 1) which is not divisible by 
any of the primes p lt p it ■ **, pn and is larger than any of them. 

(b) The idea of the solution is somewhat similar to that of 
problem (a). The proof involves the result of problem 247 (c).
